Synchronously Achieving Plasmonic Bi Metal Deposition and I(-) Doping by Utilizing BiOIO3 as the Self-Sacrificing Template for High-Performance Multifunctional Applications	Herein, we uncover simultaneously achieving plasmonic Bi metal deposition and I(-) doping by employing wide-band-gap BiOIO3 as the self-sacrificing template. It was synthesized via a facile NaBH4-assisted in situ reduction route under ambient conditions. The reducing extent as well as photocatalytic levels can be easily modulated by controlling the concentration of NaBH4 solution. It is interesting that the band gap of BiOIO3 can be continuously narrowed by the modification, and the photoresponse range is drastically extended to cover the whole visible region. Bi/I(-) codecorated BiOIO3 not only exhibits profoundly upgraded photoreactivity in comparison with pristine BiOIO3 but also shows universally strong photooxidation properties toward decomposition of multiple industrial contaminants and pharmaceutical, including phenol, 2,4-Dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP), bisphenol A (BPA), dye model Rhodamine (RhB), tetracycline hydrochloride, and gaseous NO under visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm) or simulated solar light irradiation. It also outperforms the well-known and important photocatalysts C3N4, BiOBr, and Bi2WO6 for NO removal. The cooperative effects from Bi SPR and I(-) doping endow BiOIO3 with a narrowed band gap and highly boosted separation of charge carriers, thus responsible for the outstanding catalytic activity. The present study provides an absorbing candidate for practical environmental applications and also furthers our understanding of developing high-performance photocatalysts by manipulating manifold strategies in a facile way.
Fluorescence-Quenched Sensor for Trinitophenol in Aqueous Solution Based on Sulfur Doped Graphitic Carbon Nitride	In this study, we report on successful attempt towards the synthesis of sulfur self-doped g-C3N4 by directly heating thiourea in air. The synthesized materials were characterized using UV-vis spectral technique, FT-IR, XRD and TEM analysis. Further, the obtained material shows an excellent detection of carcinogenic TNP(Tri nitro phenol) in the presence of 10-fold excess of various other common interferences. The strong inner filter effect and molecular interactions(electrostatic, π-π, and hydrogen bonding interactions) between TNP and the S-g-C3N4 Nano sheets led to the fluorescence quenching of the Sg- C3N4 Nano sheets with an excellent selectivity and sensitivity towards TNP compared to that of other nitro aromatics under optimal conditions and the detection limit calculated was found to be 6.324 nM for TNP. The synthesized nanocomposite provides a promising platform for the development of sensors with improved reproducibility and stability for ultra-sensitive and selective sensing of TNP.
Subunit interactions in tyrosinase from frog epidermis in immobilized enzyme systems	1. Frog epidermis tyrosinase was coupled to Sepharose activated with low concentrations of CNBr. The tetrameric form of the enzyme was linked to the matrix via its subunits. Dissociation of the bound active enzyme with guanidinium chloride yielded an active immobilized dimeric derivative. 2. Immobilized dimeric derivative was able to interact with soluble subunits formed transiently during renaturation. An 85% recovery of the native dopa oxidase specific activity was achieved after hybridization. 3. Fluorescence spectra of different immobilized derivatives suggested that tryptophan residues were involved in the interactions between tyrosinase subunits. 4. It is suggested that the activation of the subunits of tyrosinase involves a conformational change towards a more unfolded state, which favours a reassociation to the dimeric active state.
Preparation and Photocatalytic Properties of g-C3N4/TiO2 Hybrid Composite	g-C3N4/TiO2 composite were prepared by hydrolysis of Ti(OC4H9n)(4) and the precursors of g-C3N4 at room temperature and annealing in nitrogen atmosphere X-ray diffraction results revealed that all the products were anatase structure The chemical nature of O N of the g-C3N4/TiO2 were identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, presenting N-Ti-O and N-Ti-N doping status of the composite The g-C3N4/TiO2 composite showed better photocatalytic activity for the UV and visible-light degradation of Rhodamine B
Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) alleviates cadmium-induced phytotoxicity to rice (Oryza sativa L.)	In the present study, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was synthesized in a tube furnace and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). Different concentrations (0-200 mg/L) of g-C3N4 were prepared in nutrient solution amended with or without 20 mg/L CdCl2 for the greenhouse study. Rice seedlings were exposed to g-C3N4 and Cd for 20 days. Our results suggest that 200 mg/L g-C3N4 significantly increased the fresh weight and root and shoot length as compared with the control, and notably alleviated Cd-induced toxicity. The addition of 200 mg/L g-C3N4 significantly reduced the root and shoot Cd content by approximately 14% and 23%, respectively. In addition, 200 mg/L g-C3N4 significantly elevated the nitrogen content and decreased C/N ration in rice shoots; most importantly, it alleviated Cd-induced nitrogen reduction. Our findings demonstrated the potential of g-C3N4 in regulating plant growth and minimizing the Cd-induced phytotoxicity, and shed light on providing a new strategy to maintain heavy metal contamination in agriculture using a low-cost and environmental friendly NMs.
Simulated Solar Light Responsive Carbon Nitride/TiO2 Nanofiber Heterojunction Photocatalyst: Synthesis, Characterization, and Photocatalytic Performance	A carbon nitride/TiO2 nanofiber heterojunction photocatalyst that is responsive to simulated solar light is prepared by a simple self-assembly method. X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are used to characterize the prepared catalysts. The results indicate that the TiO2 nanofiber is coated by the g-C3N4 sheet to form a core/shell structure, which is favorable for the fast interfacial charge transfer and separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The activity and stability of carbon nitride/TiO2 nanofiber heterojunction photocatalyst are tested in the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) under simulated solar light. The rate constant of TiNF(0.3)-CN is found to be 0.044 min(-1), which is 4 and 2.2 times higher than that of single TiO2 nanofiber and g-C3N4, respectively. A possible mechanism is proposed.
Construction of Highly Efficient 3D/2D MnO2/g-C3N4 Nanocomposite in the Epoxidation of Styrene with TBHP	MnO2/g-C3N4 nanocomposites were facilely synthesized by calcining the mixture of bulk g-C3N4 and MnO2 precursors. The effects of the morphology of MnO2 precursors and the mass ratio of MnO2, to g-C3N4 on the micromorphology, chemical compositions, and catalytic properties of MnO2 NP/g-C N-3(4) nanocomposites were studied. It was found that the 3D polyhedral morphology and multiphase polycrystalline structure of MnO2 were propitious to generate the strong interaction between MnO2 and g-C3N4, which led to the enhanced concentrations of surface low-valence Mn species, oxygen vacancies, and graphitic N species. Meanwhile, when the mass ratio of MnO2 NP to g-C3N4 was 8/100, the interface of 8MnO(2)NP/UCN possessed the optimum synergistic effect of MnO2 NP and g-C3N4, contributing to the superior catalytic performance of 8MnO(2)NP/UCN with much higher yield of styrene oxide compared to other counterparts.
Temperature-directed synthesis of N-doped carbon-based nanotubes and nanosheets decorated with Fe (Fe 3 O 4, Fe 3 C) nanomaterials	The coupling of N-doped carbon materials with transition-metal-based materials shows great promise for electrochemical energy conversion and storage. However, it is still a big challenge to achieve high-performance carbon-based composites with a simplified preparation process and a general synthesis strategy. Herein, a facile and efficient one-pot synthetic strategy was developed for the simultaneous preparation of N-doped one-dimensional carbon nanotube-based hybrids and two-dimensional carbon nanosheet-based hybrids through temperature-directed fabrication. A mixture containing dicyandiamide (DCDA), glucose, and FeCl3·6H2O as precursors was used. C3N4, derived from the pyrolysis of DCDA, acted not only as the self-sacrificing template to guide the formation of the distinct shape and structure of the hybrids, but also as the N and C sources for N-doped carbon materials. Meanwhile, FeCl3·6H2O served both as the catalyst to induce the transformation of the structure and as the reactive template affording an Fe reservoir to generate various Fe species. Effects of temperature on the structure and morphology as well as on the corresponding electrochemical performance of the hybrids were further studied in detail. Moreover, the as-prepared products demonstrated good capacitive performance. This work provides good guidance for the facile and efficient preparation of N-doped carbon-based materials with a distinct shape and structure.
Graphitic Carbon Nitride-Based Materials as Catalysts for the Upgrading of Lignocellulosic Biomass-Derived Molecules	The use of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)-based catalysts in the upgrading of lignocellulosic biomass significantly contributes to the greener production of biofuels, polymer precursors, and building blocks. In recent years, several catalysts based on g-C3N4 have been developed and applied in both photocatalyzed and non-photocatalyzed (thermal) reactions. This Review provides an overview on the upgrading of lignocellulosic biomass deploying several compositions of g-C3N4-based catalysts.
MoS2 quantum dots interspersed WO3 nanoplatelet arrays with enhanced photoelectrochemical activity	Facing the issues for ineffective visible light utilization, insufficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs of WO3 photoanode, herein, ultrasmall MoS2 quantum dots (QDs) are exploited as surface sensitizers to boost the photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of MoS2/WO3. The MoS2/WO3 photoanode is prepared by decorating 2D WO3 nanoplatelet arrays with ultra-small MoS2 QDs via a facile and effective assembly method. The interspersing of MoS2 QDs, not only broadens the photoabsorption region, but also provides more active sites for the surface reactions and enhances charge separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, leading to a 2.13-fold enhancement in photocurrent density at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl (1.23 V vs. RHE). MoS2/WO3 photoanodes hold potentialities for the straightforward building of molecular level devices for PEC production. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Preparation of SnO2/conjugated polyvinyl alcohol derivative nanohybrid with good performance in visible light-induced photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI)	A new visible light-responsive SnO2/conjugated polyvinyl alcohol derivative (CPVA) nanohybrid photocatalyst was prepared by an easy-to-implement three-step method, using low cost and easily accessible SnCl4 center dot 5H(2)O, PVA and H2O as the source materials. The photocatalytic properties of the as-prepared SnO2/CPVA nanohybrid were examined through the reduction of aqueous Cr(VI) in the presence of citric acid and visible light (lambda > 420 nm). The compositional and structural analysis of SnO2/CPVA nanohybrid after the recycle stability test was also performed. The photodegradation efficiency of Cr(VI) using SnO2/CPVA nanohybrid and other reported visible light-responsive photocatalysts (g-C3N4 and ZnFe2O4/CPVC nanocomposite) were compared. Besides, the effects of the solution pH and different water matrices (including black chromium electroplating solution, industrial cooling water, yellow sea water, and tap water) on the efficiency of photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) by SnO2/CPVA nanohybrid were also investigated. The results manifested that the as-prepared SnO2/CPVA nanohybrid had both high activity and good stability in photocatalytic reduction of aqueous Cr(VI) under visible light irradiation. According to the results of photoabsorption, photoluminescence, transient photocurrent response, electrochemical impedance, and Mott-Schottky characterization, it was deduced that the notable visible light-activated photocatalysis of SnO2/CPVA nanohybrid may originate from its prominent visible light-absorbing ability and the efficient electron transfer from CPVA to SnO2 (which results in the efficient separation of photoinduced charge carriers of CPVA as well as the sensitization of SnO2).
Highly efficient visible-light-driven photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline by a Z-scheme g-C3N4/Bi 3 TaO 7 nanocomposite photocatalyst	Spatial separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs is one of the most important factors that determine the efficiency of a photocatalyst. It is well acknowledged that the fabrication of heterogeneous photocatalysts with two different inorganic semiconductors is a good strategy to effectively improve the charge separation of electrons and holes. This study describes a novel visible light-induced g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 composite photocatalyst with superior photocatalytic properties toward the degradation of tetracycline (TC) by visible light irradiation. The formation of heterojunctions significantly improves the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, which is confirmed by the photocurrent density and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Electron spin resonance examination and trapping experiments confirm that the photoinduced active species (˙OH and ˙O2-) are responsible for the degradation of tetracycline. Based on the experimental results, a possible Z-scheme system reaction mechanism for the g-C3N4/Bi3TaO7 composite towards the degradation of TC under visible light was proposed.
An overview of the structural, textural and morphological modulations of g-C3N4 towards photocatalytic hydrogen production	Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is gaining more and more importance as a photocatalytic material due to its promising electronic band structure and high thermal and chemical stability. Very recently, a variety of nanostructured g-C3N4 photocatalysts with varying shapes, sizes, morphologies and electronic band structures have been reported for application in photocatalytic research. This critical review represents an extensive overview of the synthesis of a variety of g-C3N4 nanostructured materials with a controllable structure, morphology and surface modification for superior electronic properties. This article highlights the design of efficient photocatalysts for the splitting of water into hydrogen gas using solar energy. Finally, in the summary and outlook, this article highlights the ongoing challenges and opportunities of g-C3N4. It is also hoped that this review will stimulate further investigation and will open up new possibilities to develop new hybrid g-C3N4 materials with new and exciting applications.
Acetic acid induced synthesis of laminated activated carbon nitride nanostructures	Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), composed of only non-metallic elements, possesses a graphene-like structure and an appropriate band gap around 2.7 eV. It is finding its promising applications in sustainable chemistry. In this paper, highly ordered laminated porous carbon nitride nanostructures (OLP-C3N4) are successfully prepared via a novel two-step hydrothermal-calcination method using acetic acid as the order-inducing agent and pore-forming agent. Acetic acid and melamine are first hydrothermally synthesized to form a solid precursor. Then, the precursor is calcinated to obtain the product. The electrostatic interaction existed between acetic acid and melamine in water during the hydrothermal process is considered to play a key role on the formation of layered nanostructures. While, carboxyl group in acetic acid is favorable for the porous structure of the products. The prepared carbon nitride nanostructures exhibit high surface area and show excellent electric transport and optical properties, which may have wide applications in catalytic, adsorptive and battery materials fields. This work opens a novel way for the preparing hierarchical porous materials with unique properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays wrapped with g-C3N4 nanoparticles for efficient charge separation and increased photoelectrocatalytic degradation of phenol	Novel graphitic carbon nitride nanoparticles (NPs)-wrapped TiO2 nanotube arrays (NTAs) (g-C3N4/TiO2) were fabricated by a two-step method including an electrochemical anodization technique followed by impregnation under vacuum using urea as precursor. The as-prepared photoelectrode exhibited outstanding photoelectric properties and excellent photelectrocatalytic (PEC) performance for the degradation of phenol under stimulated solar light, which was due to the enhanced light absorption property and improved charge separation efficiency. The introduction of g-C3N4 NPs strongly decreased the charge transfer resistance and boosted the charge separation efficiency of TiO2. The optimum ratio of the g-C3N4/TiO2 yielded a pronounced 4.18-fold higher photocurrent density than TiO2. Besides, the combination of g-C-3 N-4 NPs could negatively shift for the flat band potential of TiO2, resulting in an enhanced reduction property for the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. The PEC process for the degradation of phenol over g-C3N4/TiO2 was much higher than the sum of photocatalytic (PC) and electrocatalytic (EC) processes indicating that a photoelectric synergy was achieved on the as-prepared photoelectrode and resulting in an improved PEC performance for the composite photoelectrode.

The light-harvesting polypeptides of Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides R-26.1. I. Isolation, purification and sequence analyses	Four low-molecular-mass polypeptides were isolated and purified from chromatophore membranes of Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides blue-green mutant R-26.1 by a combination of gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography in organic solvents. On dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels, the purified polypeptides comigrate with bands LH-1, LH-2 and LH-3 known to be related to the antenna-pigment-protein complexes. The complete primary structures were elucidated by automated Edman degradation of the intact polypeptides and of overlapping C-terminal fragments obtained after chemical cleavage at tryptophan and methionine residues. The C-termini were verified by hydrazinolysis and, in one case where an overlapping C-terminal fragment could not be obtained, by digestion with carboxypeptidase A. The four polypeptides show a tripartite structure: i.e. a polar N-terminal region is separated from a polar C-terminal region by a segment of about 21 predominantly hydrophobic amino-acid residues. All hydrophobic segments contain a characteristic conservative histidine residue. The C-terminal region is reduced to only a few amino acids in the two polypeptides which together form band LH-3, i.e. LH-3A and LH-3B. Their extended N-terminal region is rich in charged residues and contains an additional conserved histidine residue close to the beginning of the hydrophobic segment. These properties place LH-3A and LH-3B into subgroup (beta-polypeptides: B 870-beta and B 850-beta, respectively). LH-1 and LH-2 appear to form another subgroup (alpha-polypeptides: B 870-alpha and B 850-alpha, respectively) as suggested during a search for conservative elements within their sequences (structural basis for classification). N-Terminal analyses carried out with intact antenna-pigment-protein complexes revealed the following: (i) LH-1 and LH-3 are associated with the B 870 complex in Rp. sphaeroides 24.1 (wild type), (ii) the same polypeptides are almost exclusively present in chromatophore membranes of Rp. sphaeroides R-26, a blue-green mutant which absorbs at 870 nm, (iii) LH-2 and LH-3B are the constituent polypeptides of the B 800-850 complex of Rp. sphaeroides 2.4.1 and of the spectrally altered B 850 complex isolated from the blue-green mutant R-26.1 which absorbs at 860 nm. This mutant contains LH-2 and LH-3B along with LH-1 and LH-3A and apparently is able to form both types of antenna complexes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
Graphitic Carbon Nitride (g-C3N4) Nanosheets/Graphene Composites: In Situ Synthesis and Enhanced Photocatalytic Performance	A facile In Situ growth method was presented here for the preparation of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)/graphene composites, in which the direct growth and deposition of g-C3N4 nanosheets from organic N and C sources on the graphene surfaces was achieved to form the 3D contacted structure. The resulting 3D architecture possessed multilevel porous structure and efficient g-C3N4/graphene interfaces, which facilitated the fast electron transfer at the interfaces. Photoluminescence spectra showed that the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes in the g-C3N4/graphene composites was greatly inhibited by the introduction of graphene, indicating the more efficient separation of electrons and hole in the g-C3N4/graphene composites than in pure g-C3N4. The catalytic activity of g-C3N4/graphene composite photocatalyst was enhanced by over two fold compared to pure g-C3N4 for removal of Rhodamine B under simulated sun light irradiation. This work indicates that the metal-free g-C3N4/graphene composite photocatalyst is a promising nanomaterial for further applications in water treatment.
Cost-effective fabrication of ZnO/g-C3N4 composite film coated stainless steel meshes for visible light responsive photocatalysis	The ZnO and ZnO/g-C3N4 composite films were deposited on stainless steel meshes having different apertures (370, 500, 780 and 1000 mu m) using a simple cost-effective automated tubular nebulizer spray pyrolysis technique for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. Photocatalytic studies were done for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) and malachite green (MG). The photocatalytic studies reveal that the ZnO/g-C(3)N(4 )composite film having smallest aperture exhibits superior photocatalytic activity compared with other meshes. The degradation efficiency of this composite film for MB and MG dyes are 97% (irradiation time-75 min) and 95% (irradiation time-45 min), whereas for pristine ZnO film the corresponding efficiencies are only 88% and 87%. The aperture size related photocatalytic efficiency variations and the effect of g-C(3)N(4 )addition on the photocatalytic efficiency of ZnO films have been addressed with appropriate supporting experimental evidences and reports.
Cost-Efficient Graphitic Carbon Nitride as an Effective Photocatalyst for Antibiotic Degradation: An Insight into the Effects of Different Precursors and Coexisting Ions, and Photocatalytic Mechanism	In this study, the photocatalytic activity of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3 N4 ) synthesized via different precursors (urea, thiourea, and dicyandiamide) is investigated in the degradation process of tetracycline. Owing to the efficient charge separation and transfer, prolonged radiative lifetime of charge, large surface area, and nanosheet morphology, the urea-derived g-C3 N4 exhibits superior photocatalytic activity for tetracycline degradation under visible-light irradiation. This performance can compare with that of most reported g-C3 N4 -based composite photocatalysts. Through the time-circle degradation experiment, the urea-derived g-C3 N4 is found to have an excellent photocatalytic stability. The presence of NO3 - , CH3 COO- , Cl- and SO4 2- ions with the concentration of 10 mm inhibits the photocatalytic activity of urea-derived g-C3 N4 , where this inhibitory effect is more obvious for Cl- and SO4 2- ions. For the coexisting Cu2+ , Ca2+ , and Zn2+ ions, the Cu2+ ion exhibits a significantly higher inhibitory effect than Ca2+ and Zn2+ ions for tetracycline degradation. However, both the inhibitory and facilitating effects are observed in the presence of Fe3+ ion with different concentration. The h+ , . OH and . O2 - radicals are confirmed as major oxidation species and a possible photocatalytic mechanism is proposed in a urea-derived g-C3 N4 reaction system. This study is of important significance to promote the large-scale application of g-C3 N4 photocatalysts in antibiotic wastewater purification.
Ag2CrO4 nanoparticles loaded on two-dimensional large surface area graphite-like carbon nitride sheets: simple synthesis and excellent photocatalytic performance	Graphite-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with a large surface area was prepared through thermal condensation of guanidine hydrochloride at 650 °C. Various amounts of silver chromate (Ag2CrO4) nanoparticles with small size were highly loaded on the g-C3N4 by a simple co-precipitation method at room temperature. The chemical constituents, surface structure and optical properties of the resultant Ag2CrO4/g-C3N4 composites were thoroughly characterized. And the photocatalytic performances were evaluated by degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and phenol, the experimental results indicated that the as-prepared Ag2CrO4/g-C3N4 composites presented excellent photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation. With the mass ratio of Ag2CrO4 to g-C3N4 at 1 : 2, the Ag2CrO4/g-C3N4 composites exhibited optimal photocatalytic activity for degrading RhB, approximately 6.1 and 10.4 times higher than those on pure g-C3N4 and bare Ag2CrO4 particles. The improved photocatalytic activity was mainly attributed to the combined effect including the larger surface area, highly dispersed smaller Ag2CrO4 nanoparticles, stronger visible absorption and higher charge separation efficiency of the Ag2CrO4/g-C3N4 composites. Moreover, the possible mechanism for the photocatalytic activity was tentatively proposed.
Enhanced Photocatalysis of g-C3N4 Thermally Modified with Calcium Chloride	Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with improved photocatalysis was prepared via thermal polymerization of dicyandiamide with the assistance of calcium chloride. The photocatalytic activity of the modified product was optimized by changing the weight ratio of calcium chloride to dicyanodiamine, and the final products were characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM, TEM, XPS, BET, DRS and PL spectra. The results indicate that calcium chloride could lower the crystalline sizes of g-C3N4 due to its coordination effect with the edge ammonia of g-C3N4. The Valence band level decreased after the modification with higher oxidation capability. The photo-generated hole and the superoxide radical are the main active species in the degradation process. As a typical performance, the degradation rate of the modified sample is more than 50 times higher than that of the un-modified carbon nitride. Due to the weakened visible light absorption of the modified catalyst, the degradation of RhB can be mainly attributed to its excitation and enhanced transfer of electrons to the catalyst.[GRAPHICS].
Purification of mouse interferon on specifically purified immunoadsorbent	A one-step purification procedure using affinity chromatography on purified anti-interferon antibodies makes possible to obtain highly purified interferon preparations. Antibodies against purified mouse fibroblast interferon were covalently bound to activated CNBr-Sepharose 4B. This immunoadsorbent had a binding capacity of 125,800 mouse fibroblast interferon units per 4.8 ml of gel. The binding capacity for mouse leukocytes was similar while for serum interferon it was lower. When analyzed in polyacrylamide gel, the electrophoretic profiles of purified IF had a similar shape to that of unpurified IF. The results of this purification procedure are not influenced by volume, biological activity and/or purity of the starting material.
Experimental studies on photocatalytic reduction of CO2 using AgBr decorated g-C3N4 composite in TEA mediated system	Graphitic carbon nitride modified with silver bromide (AgBr/g-C3N4) composite was prepared by modified deposition-precipitation method. The phase structure, optical property, thermo stability, morphological structure, elemental composition, surface area and surface charge of AgBr/g-C3N4 composite were characterized using various analytical techniques. XRD spectrum for AgBr/g-C3N4 composite reveals that cubic phase of AgBr crystal is deposited on the surface of g-C3N4. The AgBr/g-C3N4 composite showed slightly enhanced visible light active, which was confirmed from UV-vis absorbance spectra. The BET surface area of pure AgBr, g-C3N4 and AgBr/g-C3N4 composite were 4.802 m(2)/g, 12.74 m(2)/g and 15.52 m(2)/g respectively. Subsequently, the photocatalytic activity of AgBr/g-C3N4 composite was evaluated towards the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) under UV light irradiation. The effects of reductants, pH, catalyst dosage and stability were also studied. The maximum production yield of methane (61.52 mu mol/g), hydrogen (58.89 mu mol/g) and acetone (3.32 mu mol/g) in triethanolamine (TEA) medium was observed at pH 9 and catalyst dosage 3 g/L. It was inferred that AgBr/g-C3N4 composite has the highest photocatalytic activity than that of pure g-C3N4.
Two-dimensional C 3 N based sub-10 nanometer biosensor	Detection and sequencing of various nucleobases are of immense usefulness that can revolutionise future medical diagnostics procedures. In this regard, the newly discovered 2D material, C3N, has demonstrated supreme potential for future nanoelectronic and spintronic developments due to its unique sets of electronic properties and structural similarity to graphene. Herein, we have investigated the effect of various nucleobases in the close vicinity of a C3N nanoribbon. Our extensive calculations revealed significant changes in the transport behaviour in the presence of DNA/RNA molecules. The transport response can be further modified through the (i) incorporation of doping, (ii) presence of defects, (iii) concentration of the adsorbed molecule, etc. Furthermore, in the presence of a gate voltage in a field-effect transistor (FET) geometry, the conductivity response can be improved significantly with an ∼100% change in the presence of an adsorbed molecule. The observation of a negative differential resistance (NDR) in the C3N system has also been reported here for the first time. Our current observation demonstrates the usefulness of the C3N system as a next generation bio-sensor for the sequencing of various nucleobases, offering new leads for future developments in bioelectronics, superior sensing architectures and sustainable designs.
Production of Hydrogen Peroxide by Photocatalytic Processes	Hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) has received increasing attention because it is not only a mild and environmentally friendly oxidant for organic synthesis and environmental remediation but also a promising new liquid fuel. The production of H2 O2 by photocatalysis is a sustainable process, since it uses water and oxygen as the source materials and solar light as the energy. Encouraging processes have been developed in the last decade for the photocatalytic production of H2 O2 . In this Review we summarize research progress in the development of processes for the photocatalytic production of H2 O2 . After a brief introduction emphasizing the superiorities of the photocatalytic generation of H2 O2 , the basic principles of establishing an efficient photocatalytic system for generating H2 O2 are discussed, highlighting the advanced photocatalysts used. This Review is concluded by a brief summary and outlook for future advances in this emerging research field.
Water hyacinth derived carbon quantum dots and g-C3N4 composites for sunlight driven photodegradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol	Carbon dots (CDs) were successfully derived from water hyacinth leaves and the binary composite was achieved by incorporating CDs with g-C3N4 through hydrothermal treatment. The average particle size of CDs was found to be 3.1 nm and a blue-green fluorescence was emitted under the UV light irradiation. Both of the composites loaded with 20 wt.% (20CDs/g-C3N4) and 40 wt.% (40CDs/g-C3N4) of CDs achieved the highest degradation efficiency of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) with 1.7 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4. This work successfully improved the properties of g-C3N4 by elongating the lifetime of photogenerated electrons and widening the visible light response. Both of 20CDs/g-C3N4 and 40CDs/g-C3N4 recorded the highest photocatalytic performance in degrading 2,4-DCP with degradation rate constant of 0.0194, and 0.0186 min(-1), respectively. This is contributed by the prolonged charge carrier lifetime in 20CDs/g-C3N4; good visible light absorption and high specific surface area in 40CDs/g-C3N4. For the scavenger test, hole (h(+)) and superoxide radical (center dot O-2(-)) were acknowledged as the key active species in photocatalysis.
The uncoupling protein dimer can form a disulfide cross-link between the mobile C-terminal SH groups	Isolated uncoupling protein (UCP) can be cross-linked, by various disulfide-forming reagents, to dimers. The best cross-linking is achieved with Cu2+-phenanthroline oxidation. Because cross-linking is independent of UCP concentration and prevented by SDS addition, a disulfide bridge must be formed between the two subunits of the native dimer. Cross-linking is prevented by SH reagent and reversed by SH-reducing reagents. In mitochondria, cross-linking of UCP with disulfide-forming agents is even more efficient than in isolated state. It proves that UCP is a dimer in mitochondria, before isolation. Disulfide-bridge formation does not inhibit GTP-binding to UCP. Cross-linked UCP re-incorporated in proteoliposomes either before or after cross-linking fully retains the H1-transport function. Rapid cross-linking by membrane impermeant reagents indicates a surface localization of the C-terminus in soluble UCP and projection to the outer surface in mitochondria. Intermolecular disulfide-bridge formation in a dimer requires juxtaposition of identical cysteines at the twofold symmetry axis. A rigid juxtaposition of cysteines is unlikely, unless intended for a native disulfide bridge. The absence of such a bridge in UCP suggests that juxtaposition of cysteines is generated by high mobility. In order to localize the cysteine involved, cross-linked UCP was cleaved by BrCN. The CB-7 C-terminal peptide, which contains cysteines at positions 287 and 304, disappears. Limited trypsinolytic cleavage, previously shown to occur at Lys-292, removed cross-linking in UCP both in the solubilized and mitochondrially bound state. The cleaved C-terminal peptide of 11 residues contains only cystein-304 which, thus, should be the only one (out of 7 cysteines in UCP) involved in the S-S bridge formation. Obviously, the C-terminal location of the cysteine, because of its high mobility, permits juxtapositioning for cross-linking. This agrees with predictions from hydrophobicity analysis that the last 14 residues in UCP protrude from the membrane.
A Nitrogen-Rich Covalent Triazine Framework as a Photocatalyst for Hydrogen Production	Covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) have emerged as new candidate materials in various research areas such as catalysis, gas separation storage, and energy-related organic devices due to their easy functionalization, high thermal and chemical stability, and permanent porosity. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of a CTF rich in cyano groups (CTF-CN) by the solvothermal condensation of 2,3,6,7-tetrabromonapthalene (TBNDA), Na-2(1,1-dicyanoethene-2,2-dithiolate), and 1,3,5-tris-(4-aminophenyl)-triazine (TAPT) at 120 degrees C. XRD, SEM, and TEM characterization studies revealed CTF-CN to be amorphous and composed of ultrathin 2D sheets. CTF-CN possessed strong absorption at visible wavelengths, with UV-vis measurements suggesting a band gap energy in the range 2.7-2.9 eV. A 5 wt.% Pt/CTF-CN was found to be a promising photocatalyst for hydrogen production, affording a rate of 487.6 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) in a H2O/TEOA/CH3OH solution under visible light. The photocatalytic activity of CTF-CN was benchmarked against g-C3N4 for meaningful assessment of performance. Importantly, the 5 wt.% Pt/CTF-CN photocatalyst exhibited excellent thermal and photocatalytic stability. Further, as a nitrogen-rich porous 2D material, CTF-CN represents a potential platform for the development of novel electrode material for fuel cells and metal ion batteries.
Carbonized MoS2: Super-Active Co-Catalyst for Highly Efficient Water Splitting on CdS	Searching photocatalysts for efficient hydrogen production has been a challenging issue for solar-energy harvesting. Using co-catalyst is proven to be an effective approach to improve the efficiency of photocatalyst in water-splitting. Here, we report that carbonized MoS2 (MoS2/Mo2C) can be a superactive co-catalyst in solar-driven hydrogen production. We show that MoS2/Mo2C decorated CdS achieves a high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate (34 mmol/h/g, similar to 112 times higher than pure CdS) and excellent apparent quantum efficiency (41.4% at 420 nm). The outstanding photocatalytic performance of MoS2/Mo2C/CdS is attributed to the metallic characteristic of MoS2/Mo2C and suitable Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption, leading to enhanced light absorption, fast separation and transportation of photoinduced carriers, and optimal activity in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We further show that MoS2/Mo2C as co-catalyst can also dramatically improve the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4. Our findings demonstrate that the carbonized transition metal disulfide can be active as co-catalyst in photocatalysis, providing guidance on exploring novel photocatalysts for energy harvesting.
Noble-metal-free Ni 3 N/g-C3N4 photocatalysts with enhanced hydrogen production under visible light irradiation	The majority of visible-light photocatalysts show very low hydrogen evolution activity in the absence of noble metal co-catalysts due to their fast carrier recombination rate. Metallic interstitial nitrides have been recognized as excellent hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts and therefore are promising alternative co-catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Herein we report a low-cost, efficient, noble-metal-free visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution photocatalyst composed of Ni3N/g-C3N4 heterostructures. The as-prepared photocatalyst with a Ni3N loading content of 3 wt% shows a high hydrogen evolution rate of 169 μmol g-1 h-1, which is slightly higher than that of 3 wt% Pt modified g-C3N4 (152.0 μmol g-1 h-1). The Ni3N/g-C3N4 photocatalysts also exhibit remarkable photostability for four consecutive cycles of photocatalytic activity tests with a total reaction time of 12 hours. The excellent performance of the Ni3N/g-C3N4 photocatalyst is ascribed to the formation of an optimal number of Ni3N/g-C3N4 heterojunctions that improve photogenerated carrier separation and offer abundant photocatalytically active sites for surface reactions.
Novel g-C3N4/Ag2SO4 nanocomposites: Fast microwave-assisted preparation and enhanced photocatalytic performance towards degradation of organic pollutants under visible light	Graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4)/Ag2SO4 nanocomposites, as highly enhanced visible-light-driven photocatalysts, were prepared by a fast microwave-assisted method. The resulting g-C3N4/Ag2SO4 nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive analysis of X-rays, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, and ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy techniques. Moreover, charge separation efficiency was studied by photoluminescence measurements. Photocatalytic activity of the g-C3N4/Ag2SO4 (40%) nanocomposite in degradation of rhodamine B, methylene blue, and fuchsine is about 6, 3.8, and 3.3-folds greater than that of the g-C3N4 under visible-light illumination. Effect of microwave irradiation time, calcination temperature, and scavengers of the reactive species on the degradation reaction was also evaluated. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was mainly ascribed to the matching band energies of g-C3N4 and Ag2SO4 which leads to an improved separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Finally, the optimized nanocomposite was recycled for five times without remarkable decrease of the photocatalytic activity.
Design and synthesis of palladium/graphitic carbon nitride/carbon black hybrids as high-performance catalysts for formic acid and methanol electrooxidation	Here we report a facile two-step method to synthesize high-performance palladium/graphitic carbon nitride/carbon black (Pd/g-C3N4/carbon black) hybrids for electrooxidizing formic acid and methanol. The coating of g-C3N4 on carbon black surface is realized by a low-temperature heating treatment, followed by the uniform deposition of palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) via a wet chemistry route. Owning to the significant synergistic effects of the individual components, the preferred Pd/g-C3N4/carbon black electrocatalyst exhibits exceptional forward peak current densities as high as 2155 and 1720 mA mg(-1)pd for formic acid oxidation in acid media and methanol oxidation in alkaline media, respectively, far outperforming the commercial Pd-C catalyst. The catalyst also shows reliable stability, demonstrating that the newly-designed hybrids have great promise in constructing high-performance portable fuel cell systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Novel BiOCl-C3N4 heterojunction photocatalysts: In situ preparation via an ionic-liquid-assisted solvent-thermal route and their visible-light photocatalytic activities	Novel BiOCl-C3N4 heterojunctions were synthesized through an in situ ionic-liquid-assisted solvent-thermal method, through which a highly dispersed heterointerface was formed with almost no loss of C3N4. The composites were characterized using X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements, UV-visible light diffusion reflectance spectrometry, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The results indicated that BiOCl was dispersed on C3N4 to form heterojunction structures with high specific surface area and the ability to absorb visible light. The photocatalytic results for the degradation of methyl orange (MO) indicated that the most active heterojunction proportion is 1BiOCl:1C3N4, which increased the visible light photocatalytic activity 3.3-fold relative to that of a sample of the mechanically mixed counterpart of this composition. The enhanced performance was induced by the high separation efficiency of photoinduced electrons from the LUMO of C3N4 injected into the CB of BiOCl. We also determined that the enrichment of holes in the HOMO of the C3N4 in the present BiOCl-C3N4 heterojunctions played a dominant role in the oxidation of MO. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Preparation of porous biochar by urine assisted pyrolysis of sewage sludge and their application for Eriochrome Black T adsorption	Urine, which is composed of water, urea and mineral substance, has been treated as a kind of wastewater for a long time. In this work, urine was used as a novel activator for sludge activation and porous carbon preparation. The pyrolysis was implemented for urine transformation and sludge carbonization. It was found that urine was firstly converted to pore template g-C3N4 at 550 degrees C and g-C3N4 was in situ decomposed to form pores at 650 degrees C in the 2nd stage. The influence of pyrolysis temperature in each stage and urine to sludge ratio on properties of carbon was systematically investigated by using thermogravimetric analysis, N-2 adsorption-desorption technique and transmission electron microscope. The maximum specific surface area of the produced carbon was 253 m(2) g(-1), which was equivalent to the carbon prepared by traditional H3PO4 activation. The carbon also had higher adsorption capacity (19.1 mg g(-1)) to a typical dye Eriochrome Black T (EBT) and meanwhile showed strong stability and reusability in the repeated adsorption cycles. The implementation of using urine as bio-waste activator for porous carbon preparation would have important implications for waste recycle and reutilization.
g-C3N4 modified TiO2 nanosheets with enhanced photoelectric conversion efficiency in dye-sensitized solar cells	Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were fabricated by using g-C3N4 modified TiO2 nanosheets (CTS) as photoanode materials in this research. A thin layer of g-C3N4 was coated on the surface of TiO2 nanosheets by simply heating the mixture of TiO2 nanosheets and urea, which led to the formation of TiO2@g-C3N4 nanosheet heterostructure. The experimental results showed that the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs was obviously improved after modified by g-C3N4. The measurements of I-V characteristic indicated that the introduction of g-C3N4 could increase both the open circuit voltage and short-circuit photocurrent density. Along with the analysis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, it is considered that the thin layer of g-C3N4 can act as the blocking layer for electron backward recombination with electrolyte, which can be used as the functional material to increase the DSSC performance.

2D nanomaterials based electrochemical biosensors for cancer diagnosis	Cancer is a leading cause of death in the world. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that early diagnosis holds the key towards effective treatment outcome. Cancer biomarkers are extensively used in oncology for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Electrochemical sensors play key roles in current laboratory and clinical analysis of diverse chemical and biological targets. Recent development of functional nanomaterials offers new possibilities of improving the performance of electrochemical sensors. In particular, 2D nanomaterials have stimulated intense research due to their unique array of structural and chemical properties. The 2D materials of interest cover broadly across graphene, graphene derivatives (i.e., graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide), and graphene-like nanomaterials (i.e., 2D layered transition metal dichalcogenides, graphite carbon nitride and boron nitride nanomaterials). In this review, we summarize recent advances in the synthesis of 2D nanomaterials and their applications in electrochemical biosensing of cancer biomarkers (nucleic acids, proteins and some small molecules), and present a personal perspective on the future direction of this area.
Enhancement of visible-light-driven photocatalytic H-2 evolution from water over g-C3N4 through combination with perylene diimide aggregates	Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is among the most promising metal-free photocatalysts for H-2 production from solar-driven water reduction. However, the photocatalytic efficiency of bulk g-C3N4 powders is limited. In this work, molecular aggregates of perylene tetracarboxylic diimides (PTCDIs, a robust class of air-stable n-type organic semiconductor) were loaded via solution processing on the surface of g-C3N4, which is pre-deposited with cocatalyst Pt nanoparticles. The PTCDIs/Pt/g-C3N4 composites thus fabricated exhibit broader visible-light response than Pt/g-C3N4, and possess excellent photochemical stability. The initial intramolecular charge transfer features of the PTCDIs, as well as their energy levels being matched to g-C3N4, ensure subsequent charge separation in the PTCDIs/Pt/g-C3N4 composites. When the composites are dispersed into aqueous solutions containing triethanolamine as a sacrificial electron donor, a tenfold enhancement of H-2 evolution activity (similar to 0.375 mu mol h(-1)) is achieved compared to bare Pt/g-C3N4 under visible-light (lambda >= 420 nm) irradiation.

Self-initiated Photocatalytic Polymerization of Tough and Flexible Polyacrylamide Hydrogel/Polymeric Semiconductor C3N4 Composites	Polyacrylamide (PAM)/g-C3N4 composite materials were prepared by the self-initiation of C3N4 via its photocatalytic activity. Radical species were produced during illumination of g-C3N4 and can initiate the formation of the PAM/C3N4 composite. The effect of charcoal composited to C3N4 was also investigated. The physical properties of the PAM/g-C3N4 and PAM/g-C3N4-charcoal composite materials were analyzed using SEM technique. Photocatalytic reduction of chromium (VI) to chromium (III) was validated using the composites.
Direct growth of highly organized crystalline carbon nitride from liquid-phase pulsed laser ablation	The novel technique of liquid-phase pulsed laser ablation has been used to obtain unique, highly ordered nanostructures of crystalline carbon nitride (C3N4) via ablation of a graphite target submerged in aqueous ammonia solution. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis shows that the morphology of the carbon nitride material changes at different length scales, depending upon the synthesis conditions. The initial ablation product comprises spherical nanoparticles of carbon nitride, which then elongate to nanorods (10 nm by similar to 200 nm) with further ablation. Given sufficient concentration, the nanorods aggregate to form multilayered structures, and then ultimately larger, ordered "leaf-shaped" structures 30-50 nm by similar to 200 nm in size. With even higher concentration, these leaflike structures can themselves aggregate to create interconnected networks of large micrometer scale clusters, which ultimately rearrange to micrometer-sized flowerlike structures. The various nanostructures were characterized using a number of analysis techniques, and their composition was found to be consistent with that of crystalline alpha- or beta-phase carbon nitride. A formation mechanism for these structures is proposed that rationalizes the observed morphologies.
Rapid disinfection of E-coli by a ternary BiVO4/Ag/g-C3N4 composite under visible light: photocatalytic mechanism and performance investigation in authentic sewage	A ternary BiVO4/Ag/g-C3N4 composite was constructed by photodeposition and hydrothermal reactions, and was applied for the photocatalytic inactivation of E. coli cells in synthetic water (saline solution) and sewage. The ternary BiVO4/Ag/g-C3N4 showed significantly enhanced photocatalytic disinfection activity, achieving 6.5-log E. coli inactivation in 60 min, while binary BiVO4/g-C3N4 only inactivated 0.5-log of E. coli cells within 60 min under visible light irradiation. As proven by the reactive species, electrochemical characterization and photoluminescence spectra, Ag promoted the interfacial electron transfer, effectively suppressed the recombination of electron-hole pairs, and boosted reactive species generation in the BiVO4/Ag/g-C3N4 photocatalytic process. The Z-scheme charge transfer mode with Ag as an electron mediator was also proposed for BiVO4/Ag/g-C3N4 based on the band levels and surface reactions. Moreover, photocatalytic disinfection by BiVO4/Ag/g-C3N4 was investigated in an authentic sewage sample obtained from a local wastewater treatment plant. Inhibited disinfection activity of BiVO4/Ag/g-C3N4 was observed in sewage in comparison with that in synthetic saline solution. By mimicking the components of sewage individually, natural organic matter (NOM) was found to be the dominant component that decreased the photocatalytic disinfection activity in sewage. Through excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the mechanistic study revealed that NOM could compete with E. coli cells for reactive species and be adsorbed onto the surface of the photocatalyst, thus hindering the disinfection in sewage. This study can provide insights into developing heterojunction photocatalysts for disinfection, as well as deepening the understanding of photocatalysts as applied for treating wastewater.
Metal-free C-60/CNTs/g-C3N4 ternary heterostructures: synthesis and enhanced visible-light-driven photocatalytic performance	A metal-free C-60/CNTs/g-C3N4 nanoheterostructure with excellent visible-light photocatalysis for rhodamine B (Rh B) degradation has been reported. Via a convenient low-temperature solution-phase method, g-C3N4 nanosheets can serve as substrate for dispersion of C-60/CNTs. The loading of C-60/CNTs onto g-C3N4 nanosheets surfaces significantly enhanced visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 catalyst, for oxidation of organic pollutant (Rh B, 100%). Excellent photocatalytic properties of C-60/CNTs/g-C3N4 can be predominantly attributed to the intimate interfacial contact among constructing compounds, increased specific surface area and enhanced light adsorption efficiency resulted from C-60/CNTs carbon materials. Particularly, the synergistic heterostructure interaction remarkably hinders the electron-hole pairs recombination, giving rise to significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance of C-60/CNTs/g-C3N4 in comparison with other counterparts.
Metal- and Additive-Free Oxidation of Sulfides into Sulfoxides by Fullerene-Modified Carbon Nitride with Visible-Light Illumination	Photocatalytic selective oxidation has attracted considerable attention as an environmentally friendly strategy for organic transformations. Some methods have been reported for the photocatalytic oxidation of sulfides into sulfoxides in recent years. However, the practical application of these processes is undermined by several challenges, such as low selectivity, sluggish reaction rates, the requirement of UV-light irradiation, the use of additives, and the instability of the photocatalyst. Herein, a metal-free C60 /graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3 N4 ) composite photocatalyst was fabricated by a facile method, and well characterized by TEM, SEM, FTIR spectroscopy, XRD, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The C60 /g-C3 N4 catalyst exhibited a high photocatalytic activity at room temperature for the selective oxidation of sulfides into the corresponding sulfoxides in the presence of other functional groups, due to the synergetic roles of C60 and g-C3 N4 . Several important parameters have been screened, and this method afforded good to excellent yields of sulfoxides under optimal conditions. The superoxide radical (. O2- ) and singlet oxygen (1 O2 ) were identified as the oxidative species for the oxidation of sulfides into sulfoxides by exploring EPR experiments, and hence, a plausible mechanism for this oxidation was proposed. Moreover, the C60 /g-C3 N4 catalyst can be easily recovered by filtration and then reused at least four times without loss in activity.
Amino acid sequence of rubredoxin from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans strain 27774	The amino acid sequence of a rubredoxin from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (strain 27774) has been determined. Comparison with rubredoxins from other species reveals pervasive homology, including the regions known to provide the cysteine ligands to the iron atom in several rubredoxins. Neither an extra cysteinyl residue nor a unique histidyl residue in the new sequence is located in the sequence in such a way that, by homology, a functional role in the structure is suggested.
O-linked fucose is present in the first epidermal growth factor domain of factor XII but not protein C	Epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains are found in many proteins, particularly those of the coagulation/fibrinolytic system. We and others have demonstrated that tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and prourokinase are modified by the attachment of fucose to equivalent threonine residues within their EGF domains. Factor XII and protein C each contain two EGF domains; in both proteins, the EGF domain nearest the N terminus has a threonine residue in a position homologous to that which is fucosylated in t-PA. In protein C, this site is 3 residues from the position of another post-translational modification, beta-hydroxylation of Asp-71. We isolated peptides containing these sites to determine, primarily by mass spectrometric analysis, the presence of O-linked fucose and/or beta-hydroxyaspartate. We found that factor XII is fully fucosylated at Thr-90. Protein C is unmodified at the equivalent site (Thr-68) and is completely beta-hydroxylated at Asp-71. It has been recently reported that the first EGF domain of human factor VII has O-linked fucose at the equivalent position (Ser-60) (Bjoern, S., Foster, D. C., Thim, L., Wiberg, F. C., Christensen, M., Komiyama, Y., Pedersen, A. H., and Kisiel, W. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 11051-11057), while it is unmodified at Asp-63 despite having the consensus sequence for beta-hydroxylation at the latter site. These observations raise the possibility that O-linked fucosylation and beta-hydroxylation of EGF domains are mutually exclusive post-translational modifications.
Bio-templated 3D porous graphitic carbon nitride hybrid aerogel with enhanced charge carrier separation for efficient removal of hazardous organic pollutants	Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) hybrid aerogels (GHAs) with different proportions of g-C3N4 were prepared using g-C3N4, carboxymethyl cellulose, and β-cyclodextrin. GHAs have demonstrated high porosity, large specific surface area, rich three-dimensional network structure. GHAs demonstrated an excellent synergistic effect on the photocatalytic and adsorptive properties. Especially, GHA1 (the ratio of g-C3N4 and aerogel component was 1:1) exhibited a good synergy in photodegradation and adsorption, with a Rhodamine B (Rh B) removal up to 97.99% in 90 min. In five cycling experiments, the GHA1 showed a good long-term stability. The aerogels can be easily isolated and maintains its excellent photocatalytic properties. Compared to pure g-C3N4, GHA1 has a stronger photocurrent, which is due to the transmission of light to the surface of the catalyst, promoted photo-generated electron-hole pairs, and inhibited recombination of electros and holes. Finally, mechanistic studies reveal that the superoxide radicals (O2-) are the main active groups in the photocatalytic degradation process. This work provides a useful perspective in design and fabrication of hybrid aerogel composites with an enhanced photocatalytic activity.
High-Level Pyridinic-N-Doped Carbon Nanosheets with Promising Performances Severed as Li-Ion Battery Anodes	Defects engineering is recognized as one promising strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of carbon materials applied in energy storage field. Different from the commonly used methods, high-level N-doped carbon nanosheets are synthesized in this work via controllable removal of nitrogen atoms from nitrogen-rich graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4). The nitrogen doping levels and the relative amount of variable nitrogen types, including pyridinic-, pyrrolic-, and graphitic-N, are easily engineered for the obtained carbon nanosheets. Ultrahigh pyridinic-N content as high as 19.1 at% is achieved, closing to the highest values among the reported nitrogen-doped carbon materials. Extraordinary initial discharging capacity of 5190 mAh g(-1)at a current density of 50 mA g(-1)and excellent cycling stability (1639 mAh g(-1)after 200 cycles) as well as promising rate performance (517 mAh g(-1)at 2 A g(-1)) are demonstrated when serving as Li-ion battery anodes. The high nitrogen doping level, especially for the high pyridinic-N doping content in materials, is responsible for these outstanding electrochemical Li-ion storage performances. This work opens a new gateway to develop promising nitrogen-doped carbon materials for the practical application in energy storage devices.
Bacteria-motivated pore structure regulation of graphitic carbon nitride for enhanced H-2 evaluation under visible light irradiation	Porous graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was successfully synthesized by a simple bacterial etching method. Compared with bulk g-C3N4, the specific surface area of the porous g-C3N4 increased from 14.48 to 75.22 m(2)/g, and its photocatalytic activity was significantly enhanced by a factor of 2.49 for photocatalytic H-2 evolution. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity is attributed to the enlarged specific surface area, remarkably narrowed band gap (2.28 eV) and fast electron transportation benefit from the porous structure.

Molecular Junctions on Polymeric Carbon Nitrides with Enhanced Photocatalytic Performance	Molecular catalysts (MC), namely homogeneous catalysts, have demonstrated great promise for efficient solar-to-chemical energy conversion in the hybrid system. However, the poor interfacial interaction between MC and photosensitizers (PS) impedes the efficient and fast interfacial electron transfer. To promote interfacial communication between PS and MC, a proof-of-concept method was developed for the combination of polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) PS with bipyridine cobalt [Co(bpy)3 2+ ] MC by covalent bonds, creating molecular junctions to promote interfacial electron transfer as confirmed by transient photoluminescence lifetime and electrochemical measurements. As a result, the binary photocatalyst [Co(bpy)3 2+ /BINA2 -CN] showed extensively enhanced photocatalytic activity such as H2 and CO2 reduction in comparison with the physical mixture of Co(bpy)3 2+ and PCN. This observation highlights the importance of construction of surface molecular junctions between PS and MC to accelerate the interfacial charge-carrier mobility and, consequently, improve the photocatalytic activity.
Metal free and efficient photoelectrocatalytic removal of organic contaminants over g-C3N4 nanosheet films decorated with carbon quantum dots	As a typical metal-free semiconductor photocatalyst, a composite photocatalyst comprised of g-C3N4 nanosheets decorated with carbon quantum dots (CQDs/g-C3N4) was synthesized via a simple ultrasonic dispersion self-assembly method. The structure of the photocatalyst was determined by powder X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The photoelectrocatalytic properties of the photocatalyst were examined under visible light irradiation for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) and phenol. The results indicate that the photoelectrocatalytic activities of the CQD/g-C3N4 composites are dependent on the CQD loading quantity. The highest photoelectrocatalytic performance observed from the CQD/g-C3N4 composites was a MB degradation of 97.21% after 3 h of irradiation. A photoelectrocatalytic mechanism for the degradation of MB over the CQDs/g-C3N4 was proposed based on the above. Our results provide an invaluable methodology for the design of a highly visible lightresponsive photocatalyst based on CQD/non-metallic material and related functional materials. The metal-free photocatalyst is low-cost, shows thermal and chemical stability, and comprises earthabundant and environmentally friendly materials, and is promising for semiconductor composites and new energy applications.
La2O3-modified graphite carbon nitride achieving the enhanced photocatalytic degradation of different organic pollutants under visible light irradiation	Lanthanum (La) has some advantages of smaller radius, cheaper price and higher affinity for oxygen in rare-earth-metallic element group, and La2O3 modification may be helpful to further extend the life of photoninduced electrons and holes due to its rich energy levels, special optical properties and 4f electronic transition properties. Inspired by these items, graphite carbon nitride (GCN)/La2O3 (denoted as CN/La) was prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. The characterizations of photocatalysts were conducted using X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscope, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. The Methyl orange (MO), Methylene blue (MB) and Rhodamine B (RhB) were applied to characterize the photocatalytic performances of CN/La-x% photocatalysts under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm). CN/La-6% exhibited the optimal photodegradation efficiency, and 66.6% of MO, 99.5% of RhB and 100% of MB could be removed in 120 min. The BET surface area was improved from 8.357 m(2)g(-1) to 67.818 m(2)g(-1) and the light absorption edge shifted from 468 nm to 484 nm. In addition, the photocurrent density increased from 0.96 mu A/cm(2) to 4.82 mu A/cm(2). The improved photodegradation efficiency was attributed to larger BET surface area, extended optical absorption and enhanced charge carrier separation. More interestingly, this work lays the foundation for practical application of the La2O3-modified GCN material as the photocatalytic catalysts.
Efficient Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting by g-C3N4/TiO2 Nanotube Array Heterostructures	Well-ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTAs) decorated with graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) were fabricated by anodic oxidization and calcination process. First, TNTAs were prepared via the anodic oxidation of Ti foil in glycerol solution containing fluorinion and 20% deionized water. Subsequently, g-C3N4 film was hydrothermally grown on TNTAs via the hydrogen-bonded cyanuric acid melamine supramolecular complex. The results showed that g-C3N4 was successfully decorated on the TNTAs and the g-C3N4/TNTAs served as an efficient and stable photoanode for photoelectrochemical water splitting. The facile deposition method enables the fabrication of efficient and low-cost photoanodes for renewable energy applications.[GRAPHICS]
Facile synthesis of g-C3N4/BiOClxI1-x hybrids with efficient charge separation for visible-light photocatalysis	At present, most common catalysts are faced with the problem of high cost and only visible light response. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) consists of elements C and N that are sufficiently abundant in the world and has visible light responses, but the electron-hole recombination rate of this photocatalyst is high. In this work, we directly prepare a series of g-C3N4-bismuth oxyhalides composites via facile in-situ deposition. Bismuth oxides with different chloro-iodine ratios (BiOClxI1-x) are prepared, followed by g-C3N4 deposition, setting up interfaces and improving photogenic charge carriers transfer. By testing the compositions, CH = 8:2 in BiOClxI1-x and 10% of g-C3N4 doping amount enable the best photocatalytic performance of the samples. Under visible light irradiation, the degradation rate of rhodamine B (RhB) reaches 99% within 40 min. Through a variety of tests, the photogenerated hole (h(+)) and superoxide radical (center dot O-2(-)) are found to play key roles in the degradation process. Cl element doping and heterojunction building improve the photocatalysis capacity of g-C3N4 and broaden the visible-light response of pure BiOI.
A variant primary structure of apolipoprotein C-II in individuals of African descent	We have isolated an isoform of the protein activator of lipoprotein lipase, apolipoprotein C-II, from the very low density lipoproteins of four patients of African ancestry with hypertriglyceridemia and eruptive or pedunculated xanthomata. This protein, which we designate apolipoprotein C-II2, differs from the previously recognized species, which we denote apolipoprotein C-II1, by substitution of glutamine for lysine at residue 55, a mutation which would require only a single-base substitution in the structural gene for apolipoprotein C-II1. Each of the patients in whom apolipoprotein C-II2 was found had approximately equal amounts of apolipoprotein C-II1 and apolipoprotein C-II2 among the apoproteins of the very low density lipoproteins, suggesting that the structural genes for these proteins are allelic. Two additional apparent heterozygotes were found among the first-degree relatives of each of two of the patients in patterns compatible with monogenic autosomal transmission. Approximately equal amounts of apolipoproteins C-II2 and C-II1 were also found by isoelectric focusing in 6 of a casual series of 50 normolipidemic blacks, but none or only trace amounts of apolipoprotein C-II2 were found in 500 samples from Caucasian subjects with hyperlipidemia. These findings suggest that this polymorphism is distributed primarily among blacks, possibly reflecting some positive Darwinian selection pressure. Whether this polymorphism has a modifying effect upon the development of hyperlipemia remains to be determined.
Activation of p70s6k is associated with phosphorylation of four clustered sites displaying Ser/Thr-Pro motifs	Partial amino acid sequences were obtained from 22 internal tryptic peptides of rat liver p70s6k (M(r) 70,000 ribosomal protein S6 kinase), 3 of which were found to contain phosphorylated residues. To determine whether these sites were associated with p70s6k activation, the kinase was labeled to high specific activity with 32P(i) in Swiss mouse 3T3 cells. By sequential cleavage with CNBr and endoproteinase Lys-C followed by two-dimensional tryptic peptide analysis, it could be shown that all of the sites were located in a small endoproteinase Lys-C peptide of M(r) 2400. Analysis of the p70s6k protein sequence revealed a single candidate that could represent this peptide. Three tryptic peptides derived from the endoproteinase Lys-C fragment were chosen by a newly described computer program as the most likely candidates to contain the in vivo sites of phosphorylation. Synthetic peptides based on these sequences were phosphorylated either chemically or enzymatically and found to comigrate by two-dimensional thin-layer electrophoresis/chromatography with the four major in vivo labeled tryptic phosphopeptides. Three of the phosphorylation sites in these peptides were equivalent to those sequenced in the rat liver p70s6k. In addition, all four sites display the motif Ser/Thr-Pro, typical of cell cycle-regulated sites, and are clustered in a putative autoinhibitory domain of the enzyme.
Enhanced Fenton, photo-Fenton and peroxidase-like activity and stability over Fe3O4/g-C3N4 nanocomposites	We prepared the Fe3O4/g-C3N4 nanoparticles (NPs) through a simple electrostatic self-assembly method with a 3:97 weight ratio to investigate their Fenton, photo-Fenton and oxidative functionalities besides photocatalytic functionality. We observed an improvement of the Fenton and photo -Fenton activities of the Fe3O4/g-C3N4 nanocomposites. This improvement was attributed to efficient charge transfer between Fe3O4 and g-C3N4 at the heterojunctions, inhibition of electron-hole recombination, a high surface area, and stabilization of Fe3O4 against leaching by the hydrophobic g-C3N4. The obtained NPs showed a higher degradation potential for rhodamine B (RhB) dye than those of Fe3O4 and g-C3N4. As compared to photocatalysis, the efficiency of RhB degradation in the Fenton and photo-Fenton reactions was increased by 20% and 90%, respectively. Additionally, the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) activity of the prepared nanomaterials was studied with 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidinedihydrochloride (TMB) as a substrate. Dopamine oxidation was also examined. Results indicate that Fe3O4/g-C3N4 nanocomposites offers more efficient degradation of RhB dye in a photo-Fenton system compared with regular photocatalytic degradation, which requires a long time. Our study also confirmed that Fe3O4/g-C3N4 nanocomposites can be used as a potential material for mimicking HRP owing to its high affinity for TMB. These findings suggest good potential for applications in biosensing and as a catalyst in oxidation reactions. (C) 2017, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Fabrication of MoS2@g-C3N4 core-shell nanospheres for visible light photocatalytic degradation of toluene	The semiconductor-based photocatalytic oxidation process is considered as one of the most economical and environmentally friendly approach for the degradation of toluene. For the sake of exploring an efficient visible-light-driven photocatalysts, the MoS2@g-C3N4 core-shell nanospheres were successfully fabricated by taking the advantages of the morphology and structure of materials tailoring and semiconductor coupling, via a two-step approach including the hydrothermal method followed by ultrasonic adhering approach. The morphology, crystallinity, composition, and optical property of as-prepared catalysts were well characterized. The core-shell structure was fabricated by using MoS2 as the template and the coating of g-C3N4 improved the separation of photoinduced charges, due to the strong electronic interaction between them. The photocatalytic activity of MoS2@g-C3N4 core-shell nanospheres had been investigated by the degradation of toluene under visible light irradiation using in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The MoS2@g-C3N4 nanospheres displayed enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity, which is about 1.3 and 9.6 times than that of g-C3N4 and MoS2 nanospheres under identical conditions. Electron spin resonance (ESR) examinations confirmed the generation of center dot OH and center dot O-2(-), which were the key reactive oxygen species involved in the photocatalytic process.
A detailed structural model of cytotactin: protein homologies, alternative RNA splicing, and binding regions	A combination of cDNA sequencing of the complete coding region, protein comparisons, binding site mapping, and electron microscopic imaging has permitted the formulation of a structural model of cytotactin. Cytotactin is a large extracellular matrix glycoprotein that displays a restricted tissue distribution during development. Although there appears to be a single cytotactin gene, multiple cytotactin polypeptides and mRNAs are detected in a variety of tissues. We report here the sequences and relationships of cDNAs that encode the complete amino acid sequences of two cytotactin polypeptides in chicken brain. The translated cDNA sequences agree with those obtained by direct analysis of cytotactin and fragments of the molecule. All regions of the polypeptides appear to be identical except for a 273 amino acid segment found in the larger but not in the smaller. At their amino termini, both polypeptides contain a cysteine-rich segment that probably includes those residues that link monomers into hexamers. This segment is followed by 13 epidermal growth factor-like (EGFL) repeats and then 8 consecutive segments that each resemble the type III repeats found in fibronectin. At their carboxyl termini, the polypeptides are similar to the beta and gamma chains of fibrinogen, including a calcium-binding segment. The additional sequence in the large polypeptide is inserted after the fifth type III repeat and includes three additional type III repeats. On RNA transfer blot analyses, cytotactin cDNA probes detected a 6.4-kilobase (kb) component in both brain and gizzard and larger mRNAs in both tissues, but those in gizzard were larger by about 1 kb than those in brain. A probe specific to the insert did not hybridize to the 6.4-kb mRNA in either tissue but detected the larger mRNAs in both tissues. At least a portion of the insert is thus present in both tissues, but there may be additional inserts in the gizzard mRNAs. The proposed model of cytotactin specifies the orientation of the polypeptides, the localization of interchain disulfide bonds, the structural elements constituting the thin and thick segments (EGFL repeats and type III repeats, respectively), the terminal fibrinogen-like nodular region, and the relative location of the cell-binding region.
Constructing graphite-like carbon nitride modified hierarchical yolk-shell TiO2 spheres for water pollution treatment and hydrogen production	Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was hybridized by hierarchical yolk-shell TiO2 spheres via a solvothermal method by mixing the as-prepared g-C3N4 with the precursor of the TiO2 yolk-shell spheres in dimethylformamide (DMF). The introduction of DMF made the TiO2 yolk-shell spheres to be dispersed well on the surface of g-C3N4, thus improving the specific surface area of the materials. The g-C3N4 has a unique two-dimensional layered structure, which is favorable for hybridizing with TiO2. The sufficient contact interface between TiO2 and g-C3N4 could be beneficial to the separation of photogenerated charges. Multiple reflections of light within the interior cavities of titania microspheres with a yolk-shell structure can increase their light absorption. The photocatalytic experimental results indicated that the as-prepared composite TiO2/g-C3N4 (TCN) showed enhanced photocatalytic activities compared with pure TiO2 and g-C3N4. A suitable combination of g-C3N4 with TiO2 produced the highest photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of TCN with a yolk-shell structure is higher than that of TiO2/g-C3N4 without a yolk-shell structure. Based on our experimental results, a possible photocatalytic mechanism with holes and superoxide radical species as the main active species in photocatalysis was proposed. The TCN photocatalysts prepared in this case, with high photocatalytic activity and high stability, were a promising candidate for possible practical application in industrial production.
On the nature of carbon nitride nanocrystals formed by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition and rapid thermal annealing	Using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and atomic force microscopy, carbon nitride nanocrystals were observed in films deposited by RF plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (RF-PECVD) followed by a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) to 1000 degrees C. The (30 +/- 10) nm crystals are embedded in an amorphous matrix, and the interplanar lattice spacings suggest that the crystals are the hexagonal beta-carbon nitride phase. Investigations using Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the films show that RTA increases the sp(3) content of the films but decreases the C=N (nitrile), N-H and C-H content.

Preparation of P-g-C3N4-WS 2 nanocomposite and its application in photoelectrochemical detection of 5-formylcytosine	DNA formylation (5-formylcytosine, 5fC) is a major epigenetic modification involved in alterations in the DNA double helix structure and protein identification. Due to the low amount in all mammalian tissues and cells, it is necessary to develop a rapid, sensitive and efficient method for detecting 5fC for further understanding the biological functions of 5fC. Thus, a novel PEC biosensor was constructed using P-g-C3N4-WS2 nanocomposite as photoactive material. Firstly, AuNPs/P-g-C3N4-WS2/ITO electrode was prepared as substrate electrode. Secondly, the probe DNA and complementary DNA (containing 5fC base) was modified to the electrode surface based on the formation of Au-S bonds between AuNPs and thiol group on the probe DNA and hybridization, respectively. Finally, the amino functionalized MnO2 nanoflowers were further modified to the electrode surface by covalent interaction between the aldehyde group on the 5fC and the amino group on MnO2 nanoflowers. The sensitive and specific detection of 5fC can be achieved by oxidizing ascorbic acid with MnO2 nanoflowers and quenching the photoactivity of P-g-C3N4-WS2 nanocomposite. The sensor has a detection range of 0.01-200 nM and a detection limit of 3.8 pM. Moreover, this sensor has excellent detection specificity, stability and reproducibility.
Formation of carbon nitride films by helicon wave plasma enhanced DC sputtering	Carbon nitride films have been synthesized on Si(100) substrates by using DC sputtering assisted with a high density m = 0 mode helicon wave-excited plasma in Ar and N-2 mixture. The composition, structure and bonding state of the films were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. From the XPS analysis it was found that the nitrogen to carbon (NIC) ratio in the films could be controlled over a wide range of 0.2-0.9 by changing the target voltage and nitrogen mixing rate via the production of a high density plasma of 10(12)-10(13) cm(-3). FT-IR spectroscopy indicated the appearance of an absorption band near 2200 cm(-1) corresponding to C=N covalent bonding. The XPS analysis also suggested the existence of a beta-C3N4 phase-with sp(3) bonding correlated with the variation of the film microhardness.
In Situ Preparation and Analysis of Bimetal Co-doped Mesoporous Graphitic Carbon Nitride with Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity	HighlightsCo/Mo co-doped mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) exhibited enhanced photocatalytic performances with regard to H-2 generation (8.6 times) and Rhodamine B degradation (10.1 times) compared with pristine g-C3N4.The density functional theory calculations and optical simulation illustrate that Co/Mo co-doping and the created mesoporous structure can enhance light absorption.The enhanced activity depends on the synergistic effect of Co and Mo co-doping. AbstractA novel photocatalyst of mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) co-doped with Co and Mo (Co/Mo-MCN) has been one-pot synthesized via a simple template-free method; cobalt chloride and molybdenum disulfide were used as the Co and Mo sources, respectively. The characterization results evidently indicate that molybdenum disulfide functions as Mo sources to incorporate Mo atoms in the framework of g-C3N4 and as a catalyst for promoting the decomposition of g-C3N4, resulting in the creation of mesopores. The obtained Co/Mo-MCN exhibited a significant enhancement of the photocatalytic activity in H-2 evolution (8.6 times) and Rhodamine B degradation (10.1 times) under visible light irradiation compared to pristine g-C3N4. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations were applied to further understand the photocatalytic enhancement mechanism of the optical absorption properties at the atomic level after Co- or Mo-doping. Finite-difference time-domain simulations were performed to evaluate the effect of the mesopore structures on the light absorption capability. The results revealed that both the bimetal doping and the mesoporous architectures resulted in an enhanced optical absorption; this phenomenon was considered to have played a critical role in the improvement in the photocatalytic performance of Co/Mo-MCN.
Z-Scheme Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction on a Heterostructure of Oxygen-Defective ZnO/Reduced Graphene Oxide/UiO-66-NH2 under Visible Light	The construction of a Z-scheme heterojunction is an effective way to isolate photogenerated electron-holes and enhance the activity of the semiconductor photocatalysts. However, the Z-scheme heterojunctions based on metal-organic frameworks were rarely reported. Herein, a novel oxygen-defective ZnO (O-ZnO)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/UiO-66-NH2 Z-scheme heterojunction has been prepared by a facile solvothermal route. The morphologies, structures, and photoelectric characteristics of the acquired materials were characterized in detail. The photocatalytic activity of the O-ZnO/rGO/UiO-66-NH2 heterostructure was assessed by photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The results indicated that the O-ZnO/rGO/UiO-66-NH2 heterostructure could efficiently reduce CO2 to CH3OH and HCOOH, and its activity was significantly superior to that of O-ZnO/UiO-66-NH2 and ZnO/rGO/UiO-66-NH2. Under illumination of visible light, the yield of CH3OH and HCOOH over the O-ZnO/rGO/UiO-66-NH2 heterostructure reached 34.83 and 6.41 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) respectively. The high photoactivity of the O-ZnO/rGO/UiO-66-NH2 heterostructure should be caused by the effective spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes via a Z-scheme charge transfer. This research may well present an insight into the design and fabrication of novel Z-scheme photocatalytic systems for environmental remediation and energy conversion.
Novel g-C3N4/g-C3N4 S-scheme isotype heterojunction for improved photocatalytic hydrogen generation	Rationally designing heterostructure is a promising way to promote the charge carrier separation of intrinsic photocatalysts, thus contributes the improvement of solar to chemical energy conversion. Herein, a novel isotype heterojunction consisted of MCN and UCN, respectively derived from hydrothermally-treated melamine and urea, was synthesized. Owing to the well compatibility and matched band structure, an S-scheme charge transfer mechanism is confirmed for working on MCN/UCN isotype heterojunction, thus endowing strong redox ability, efficient charge carrier separation efficiency and prolonged lifetime. As a result, MCN/UCN exhibits improved photocatalytic water splitting activity under visible light irradiation, which displays approximately 5.5 and 1.8-fold enhancement as compared to the pure MCN and UCN, respectively. The rationally synthesized S-scheme isotype heterojunction will pave the way for developing highly efficient g-C3N4-based photocatalysts.
Two-dimensional/two-dimensional Z-scheme photocatalyst of graphitic carbon nitride/bismuth vanadate for visible-light-driven photocatalytic synthesis of imines	As an environmentally friendly strategy, photocatalytic synthesis of imines via selective oxidation of amines has inspired numerous interests. In comparison to conventional type-II heterojunction, the photogenerated electrons and holes on a Z-scheme photocatalyst has strong redox ability. Herein, we prepared a two-dimensional/two-dimensional (2D/2D) Z-scheme photocatalyst of graphitic carbon nitride nanosheet/bismuth vanadate (CNNS/BVO) with a large two-phase interface, which is favorable for the transfer and separation of photoexcited charge carriers. For selective oxidation of benzylamine to N-benzylidenebenzylamine under oxygen atmosphere and visible light irradiation, the CNNS/BVO showed much higher activity than the single CNNS and BVO. The optimized nanocomposite photocatalyst with a 50% CNNS/BVO mass ratio presented a high conversion (similar to 96%) and selectivity (similar to 99%) in 6 h oxidative coupling reaction of benzylamine. More importantly, this 2D/2D CNNS/BVO photocatalyst has good cycling stability, as well as universality for different benzylamine derivatives. Based on the experimental results, a Z-scheme mechanism was determined, where photoinduced electrons were accumulated on the conduction band (CB) of CNNS that is higher than that of BVO and holes were collected on the valence band (VB) of BVO that is lower than that of CNNS. Further, superoxide radicals and photogenerated holes are examined to the mainly active species for selective oxidation of benzylamine, and a possible reaction pathway was therefore proposed. This study demonstrates that the Z-scheme 2D/2D CNNS/BVO with high redox ability is an efficient photocatalyst for the imine synthesis.
Effects of thermal annealing on amorphous carbon nitride films by r.f. PECVD	Amorphous carbon nitride films (alpha-CNx), prepared by r.f. PECVD, were annealed at temperatures up to 800 degreesC for 1.5 h in a vacuum. The effects of heat treatment on the films, i.e. changes in the thickness, composition and structure, were investigated by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman scattering techniques. It was found that the film thickness decreased sharply by approximately 1/2 at temperatures up to 400 degreesC, and remained relatively constant at higher temperatures. Annealing at 200 degreesC did not result in any detectable change in the composition and structure except for the removal of surface contamination and weak bonds such as C-H, N-H and O-H bonds. Annealing at temperatures ranging from 200 degreesC up to 800 degreesC, resulted in the N content decreasing from approximately 18 at.% in the as-deposited films to approximately 3 at.%. The loss of N, especially those bonded to sp(2)-C, caused the rearrangement of the film structure. As a result, sp(2)-C crystallites aggregated and simultaneously the film became more graphitized. These results also showed that N atoms bonded to sp(2)-C were easily removed with increasing temperature compared to those bonded to sp(2)-C, which indicated the N-sp(3)C bonds had a higher thermal stability than N-sp(2)C bonds.

One-pot thermal polymerization route to prepare N-deficient modified g-C3N4 for the degradation of tetracycline by the synergistic effect of photocatalysis and persulfate-based advanced oxidation process	N-deficient g-C3N4 (CNx) photocatalyst was synthesized via a simple one-step thermal polymerization of urea and oxamide for the degradation of tetracycline (TC) under visible-light irradiation in the presence of persulfate (PS) activation. The microstructure and morphology of CNx were investigated by a host of characteristic technologies. The experimental result revealed that CNx/PS system displays a high efficiency in the photocatalytic process of TC degradation. The effects of different environmental factors (catalyst dose, PS dose, initial TC concentration and initial pH) on the degradation of the system were investigated. The possible intermediates products were discussed based on the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. Moreover, the toxicity of the TC solution over CNx/PS synergistic photocatalytic system was studied by the culture of bean sprouts, demonstrated that the aquatic toxicity of the TC after degradation of the system was effectively reduced.
Preparation of graphitic carbon nitride-iron bismuth composite photocatalyst by respectively dissolving bismuth source and iron source in organic solvent, adding melamine, completely dissolving, and heating to obtain sol solution	
Solid-state carbon nitrides	The synthesis of sp(3)-bonded solid-state carbon nitrides such as beta-C3N4, a potentially technologically important hard material, remains a challenge. The stability, characterization, and synthesis of both sp(2)- and sp(3)-bonded carbon nitrides is reviewed. A discussion of the alternative structures that have been proposed for C3N4 based on local density approximation (LDA) calculations is included. Recommendations are also made as to the directions that should be pursued for success in this area of research.
Hierarchical Porous Nanosheets Constructed by Graphene-Coated, Interconnected TiO 2 Nanoparticles for Ultrafast Sodium Storage	Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered promising next-generation energy storage devices. However, a lack of appropriate high-performance anode materials has prevented further improvements. Here, a hierarchical porous hybrid nanosheet composed of interconnected uniform TiO2 nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped graphene layer networks (TiO2 @NFG HPHNSs) that are synthesized using dual-functional C3 N4 nanosheets as both the self-sacrificing template and hybrid carbon source is reported. These HPHNSs deliver high reversible capacities of 146 mA h g-1 at 5 C for 8000 cycles, 129 mA h g-1 at 10 C for 20 000 cycles, and 116 mA h g-1 at 20 C for 10 000 cycles, as well as an ultrahigh rate capability up to 60 C with a capacity of 101 mA h g-1 . These results demonstrate the longest cyclabilities and best rate capability ever reported for TiO2 -based anode materials for SIBs. The unprecedented sodium storage performance of the TiO2 @NFG HPHNSs is due to their unique composition and hierarchical porous 2D structure.
Enhanced photo-induced charge separation and solar-driven photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 decorated by SO42-	SO42- decorated g-C3N4 with enhanced photocatalytic performance was prepared by a facile pore impregnating method using (NH4)(2)S2O8 solution. The photocatalysts were characterized by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and surface photovoltage (SPV) specttoscopy, respectively. The separation efficiency of photo-generated charge was investigated using benzoquinone as scavenger. The results demonstrate that sulfating of g-C3N4 increases the adsorption of rhodamine B on g-C3N4, the hydroxyl content and the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge. The photocatalytic activity of SO42-/g-C3N4 for decolorization of rhodamine B and methyl orange (MO) aqueous solution was evaluated. The result shows that loading of 6.0 wt% SO42- results in the best photocatalytic activity under simulated solar irradiation and SO42- play an important role in boosting the photocatalytic activity.

Photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical studies of visible-light active alpha-Fe2O3-g-C3N4 nanocomposites	Nanocrystalline hematite iron oxide (alpha-Fe2O3) and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) were prepared and used as precursors to synthesise alpha-Fe2O3-g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts of various compositions by a wet impregnation method. The synthesized photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS) and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). The efficiency of the photocatalysts was evaluated by photoelectrochemical measurements and photodegradation of direct red 81 (DR81) as a target textile pollutant under visible light irradiation. The alpha-Fe2O3-g-C3N4 composites exhibited remarkably improved visible-light induced photocatalytic activity. The composite photocatalysts with optimal alpha-Fe2O3 content with the highest photocatalytic activity was found to be 2%-alpha-Fe2O3-g-C3N4. The synergistic enhancement in the photocatalytic degradation of composite photocatalysts might be due to an increase in the visible-light absorption efficiency and rapid photoinduced charge separation. A possible photocatalytic mechanism has been proposed for the photocatalytic activity of alpha-Fe2O3-g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts.
Advances and applications of graphitic carbon nitride as sorbent in analytical chemistry for sample pretreatment: A review	As a green and efficient sorbent, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with aromatic tri-s-triazine units has shown great potential for the enrichment or removal of metal ions and organic aromatic compounds, which makes it a promising candidate to complement graphenes in analytical chemistry. The in-built N-rich functional groups and electronic delocalization properties endow g-C3N4with complex sorption mechanism, containing complexion, hydrogen bond, redox reaction, 7t it conjugation, hydrophobic effect, acid -base reaction and electrostatic interaction. The structure and surface physicochemical properties related to the sorption behavior are mainly depended on the preparation and sorption conditions, such as polymerization temperature, polymerization precursors, the solution pH and ionic strength. As a new sorbent, g-C3N4 has been applied to the sample pretreatment in analytical chemistry with solid -phase extraction (SPE), magnetic solid -phase extraction (MSPE), and solid -phase microextraction (SPME) modes, recently. At the same time, a series of modification methods and technologies have been exploited to modify the structural and surface physicochemical properties of g-C3N4, facilitating more effective and selective sorption process. To raise awareness of the superior properties of g-C3N4 and facilitate its applications as a sorbent in analytical chemistry, the sorption properties (sorption mechanism, influence factors of sorption behavior), applications to the sample pretreatment and structural modifications of g-C3N4 are reviewed.

STRATEGIES OF FABRICATING GRAPHENE AND GRAPHENE-ANALOGOUS 2D NANOSHEETS	Due to the unique structures and properties of graphene and graphene-analogous two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets, such as MoS2, C3N4, black phosphorus nanosheets, numerous methods were developed to prepare these 2D nanosheets, however, it is still a challenge to fabricate high quality 2D nanosheets cost-effectively on a large scale. This paper reviewed the recent progress of the strategies when fabricating graphene and graphene-analogous 2D nanosheets. These strategies were divided into five main categories based on the basic principles: physical exfoliation, chemical exfoliation, electrochemical exfoliation, chemical synthesis and chemical vapour deposition (CVD). The merits of each category were summarised and analysed, and the drawbacks were highlighted as well in detail. It provides an avenue to design and fabricate different kinds of high quality 2D nanosheets cost-effectively on a large scale for energy storage and conversion, catalysis, sensors, electronics, and so on.
Facile fabrication of g-C3N4/SnO2 composites and ball milling treatment for enhanced photocatalytic performance	Ultrafine SnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) with diameters of 2-4 nm were in situ fabricated on the surfaces of g-C3N4 material through a hydrothermal method. Ball milling was then applied to treat the obtained g-C3N4/SnO2 composites in order to improve the dispersion of SnO2 NPs as well as to strengthen the bonding between SnO2 and g-C3N4. The enhanced separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, as indicated by the photoluminescence spectrum, was achieved after the ball milling treatment. Consequently, the ball milled g-C3N4/SnO2 composite demonstrated significantly improved photocatalytic performance when degrading crystal violet, as evidenced by photodegradation efficiency enhancements of 5.06 and 3.23 times, respectively, when compared with bulk g-C3N4 and the in situ synthesized g-C3N4/SnO2 composite; these improvements were due to more useable and accessible electronic transport sites at the interfaces of the composites.

Green synthesis g-C3N4 quantum dots loading h-BN for efficient and stable photocatalytic performance	Many recent advances in constructing green metal-free materials have opened new possibilities in catalysis. To explore and enhance the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 quantum dots (CN QDs), the metal-free materials of CN QDs embedded in the h-BN was successfully synthesized by calcination the mixture of melamine and h-BN. The studies proved the CNBN has appeared red-shift due to the quantum size effect and 2D h-BN. The CN QDs were embedded into the h-BN could not only facilitate the separation and transfer, but also the h-BN terminated with -OH groups could act as active sites, thus enhanced the photocatalytic performance. Moreover, this work may pave the way for the application of CN QDs and fabricate 2D h-BN composites for green metal-free materials in another field. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Carbon nitride with simultaneous porous network and O-doping for efficient solar-energy-driven hydrogen evolution	Efficient charge separation and broaden light absorption are of crucial importance for solar-driven hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a very promising photocatalyst for this reaction. Here we report a facile precursor pre-treatment method, by forming hydrogen bond-induced supramolecular aggregates, to fabricate g-C3N4 with simultaneous novel porous network and controllable O-doping. Experimental and DFT computation identified that O doping preferentially occurs on two-coordinated N position, and the porous network and O-doping synergetically promote the light harvesting and charge separation. As a result, this material shows 6.1 and 3.1 times higher HER activity (with apparent quantum efficiency of 7.8% at 420 nm) than bulk and even 3D porous g-C3N4. This work highlights that simply pre-treating the precursor can not only control the architecture but also introduce helpful foreign atoms or monomer in the matrix, which provides a useful strategy to design and fabricate highly efficient g-C3N4 photocatalyst.

Synthesis of g-C3N4/Silica Gels for White-Light-Emitting Devices	
Enhancement of Rhodamine B Degradation by Ag Nanoclusters-Loaded g-C3N4 Nanosheets	In this paper, silver (Ag) nanoclusters-loaded graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets are synthesized and their physical properties as well as photocatalytic activities are systematically investigated by different techniques. The existence of Ag atoms in the form of nanoclusters (NCs) rather than well-crystallized nanoparticles are evidenced by X-ray diffraction patterns, SEM images, and XPS spectra. The deposition of Ag nanoclusters on the surface of g-C3N4 nanosheets affect the crystal structure and slightly reduce the band gap energy of g-C3N4. The sharp decrease of photoluminescence intensity indicates that g-C3N4/Ag heterojunctions successfully prevent the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes. The photocatalytic activities of as-synthesized photocatalysts are demonstrated through the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) solutions under Xenon lamp irradiation. It is demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity depends strongly on the molar concentration of Ag⁺ in the starting solution. The g-C3N4/Ag heterojunctions prepared from 0.01 M of Ag⁺ starting solution exhibit the highest photocatalytic efficiency and allow 100% degradation of RhB after being exposed for 60 min under a Xenon lamp irradiation, which is four times faster than that of pure g-C3N4 nanosheets.
Few layer g-C3N4 decorated flower-like ZnO for visible light photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI)	Semiconductor heterojunction nanostructures have drawn attention due to their novel structures, unique electrical and optical properties. Herein, we reported a facile vapor deposition process to construct a few layer g-C3N4/flower-like ZnO heterojunction. The structure and morphology of heterojunction were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectra. The results showed that few layer g-C3N4 was deposited on the surface of flower-like ZnO to form the close interaction. The reduction of Cr(VI) under visible light irradiation was used to evaluate the activity of photocatalyst. The heterojunction exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity, which could result in 95% of Cr(VI) reduction within 120min. The trapping experiments verified that photoelectrons played a main role in the Cr(VI) reduction process.
g-C3N4 nanofibers doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) modified electrode for simultaneous determination of ascorbic acid and acetaminophen	A fast and sensitive electrochemical sensor for simultaneous determination of ascorbic acid (AA) and acetaminophen (AP) was proposed based on g-C3N4 nanofibers (h-CN) doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene) (PEDOT) composite. PEDOT/h-CN hybrid film was directly deposited on glass carbon electrode (GCE) by in-situ electropolymerization. The incorporation of h-CN and PEDOT brought out enhanced electro-catalytic activity and additional binding sites for AA and AP, which could be ascribed to the synergetic effect between h-CN and PEDOT. Under the optimal experimental condition, the oxidation peak currents of AA and AP give linear response over the range of 4-20 mu M, 20-1800 mu M and 1-10 mu M, 10-50 mu M, respectively. The detection limit of the modified electrode was calculated to be 1.51 mu M for AA and 0.49 mu M for AP (S/N = 3). The electrochemical experiments also suggested that PEDOT/h-CN modified electrode was feasible practice for quantitative detection of AA and AP.
X-ray emission and absorption spectra of carbon nitride films prepared by laser ablation	X-ray emission and absorption spectra of carbon nitride films prepared by laser ablation were measured. The carbon x-ray spectra of films obtained in a nitrogen atmosphere were different from those of a film prepared in vacuum. It was found from DV-X alpha molecular orbital calculations on x-ray spectra that the films obtained in a nitrogen atmosphere contained bonding between carbon and nitrogen atoms, This was supported by the Fourier transform IR spectra.

Expression and biochemical characterization of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 nef gene product	nef genes from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 isolates BH10 and LAV1 (lymphadenopathy-associated virus type 1) were expressed in Escherichia coli under the deo operon promoter. The two proteins found in the soluble compartment of the bacterial lysate were purified by ion-exchange column chromatography to apparent homogeneity. Determination of the amino-terminal sequence revealed glycine as the first amino acid in the Nef protein, indicating removal of the initiator methionine during expression in E. coli. Under native conditions, the recombinant Nef protein is a monomer of 23 kilodaltons. In denaturing polyacrylamide gels, however, BH10 and LAV1 Nef proteins migrate as 28 and 26 kilodaltons, respectively. GTP binding and GTPase activity were monitored during Nef protein purification. These activities did not copurify with the recombinant Nef protein from either the BH10 or the LAV1 isolate. Purified recombinant BH10 Nef protein was used as an immunogen to elicit mouse monoclonal antibodies. A series of monoclonal antibodies were obtained which reacted with sequences at either the amino or carboxy terminus of Nef. In addition, a conformational epitope reacting with native BH10, but not LAV1, Nef was isolated.

A novel fluorescent aptasensor for aflatoxin M-1 detection using rolling circle amplification and g-C3N4 as fluorescence quencher	Aflatoxin M-1 is a prevailing natural carcinogenic mycotoxin, found in milk. Herein, we reported a sensitive fluorescent aptasensor for AFM(1), based on rolling circle amplification (RCA) technology to improve the sensitivity of the assay. The detection of AFM(1) was achieved using KYF4: Eu3+ time-resolved fluorescent nanoparticles (KYF4: Eu3+ TRFNPs) as signal probe and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheet as a quencher. The AFM1 aptamer act as a recognition element and as a primer for DNA synthesis. TRFNPs attached to complementary DNA (TRFNPs-cDNA) acts as a signal probe. In the absence of target, a rolling circle template (RCT) ligated to aptamer and RCA reaction initiated. The TRFNPs-cDNA was strengthened to amplified RCA product (RCAP) to make RCAP/TRFNPs-cDNA duplex. This duplex cannot be adsorbed onto g-C3N4, and ultimately no fluorescence quenched. In the presence of AFM(1), aptamer recognized the target and aptamer-target complex was formed. Hence, no aptamer hybridized with RCT, therefore, no RCA and duplex formation. Consequently, free TRFNPs-cDNA adsorbed onto g-C3N4 and resulted in quenched fluorescence. The assay provides a lower detection limit (0.0194 pg/mL) than the previously reported assays and has good recoveries between 92-99.8 %. Hence, the present method would be a suitable method for the quantification of small molecules.
Tuning Thermally Treated Graphitic Carbon Nitride for H-2 Evolution and CO2 Photoreduction: The Effects of Material Properties and Mid Gap States	Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is regarded as an attractive photocatalyst for solar fuel production, i.e., H-2 evolution and CO, photoreduction. Yet, its structural, chemical and optoelectronic properties are very much dependent on the synthesis method and are likely to contribute differently whether H-2 evolution or CO, reduction is considered. Little is known about this aspect making it difficult to tailor g-C3N4 structure and chemistry for a specific photoreaction. Herein, we create g-C3N4 of varying chemical, structural and optical features by applying specific thermal treatments and investigating the effects of the materials properties on solar fuel production. The samples were characterized across scales using spectroscopic, analytical and imaging tools, with particular attention given to the analyses of trap states. In the case of H-2 evolution, the reaction is controlled by light absorption and charge separation enabled by the presence of trap states created by N vacancies. In the case of CO, photoreduction, reactant adsorption appears as a dominating factor. The analyses also suggest that the thermal treatment leads to the formation of trap states located close to the valence band of g-C3N4.
Fabrication of layered Fe2P-Cd0.5Zn0.5 S nanoparticles with a reverse heterojunction for enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution	In this work, a novel two-dimensional (2D) layered Fe2P modified Cd0.5Zn0.5S (CZS) nanoparticles composites were successfully developed by an environmentally friendly solvothermal method. The Fe(2)PCZS photocatalysts were used for noble-metal-free photocatalytic H-2 generation under visible light. The rate of H-2 evolution of 13 wt% Fe2P-CZS was 24.84 mmol.g(-1).h(-1), which was 37.6 times that of CZS (0.66 mmol.g(-1).h(-1)). The formation of the 2D-0D reverse heterojunction in the Fe2P-CZS composite photocatalyst improved the transport and separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and optimized the kinetics of hydrogen evolution. Compared with Fe2P particles, the layered Fe2P cocatalysts had higher conductivity and lower hydrogen evolution overpotential. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
Zinc-Deficiency Induced g-C3N4 Nanosheets: Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation Study and Carrier Dynamics	g-C3N4 has great application prospect in the field of photocatalytic nitrogen fixation owing to the advantages of abundant raw materials, low toxicity, low consumption, high efficiency and stability. However, the low surface-active site and high carrier recombination rate limit their nitrogen fixation activities. Defect regulation is one of the effective methods to improve photocatalytic nitrogen fixation activity. In this paper, g-C3N4 nanosheets are successfully modified by ZnS containing zinc vacancy, which enhanced the carrier transport capacity and active site of g-C3N4 for photocatalytic nitrogen fixation. Thus, without any sacrificial agent, an optimized nitrogen fixation activity of 2.1 mu mol.h(-1)(105 mu mol.h(-1.)g(-1)) is achieved with the irradiation of visible light, which presents obvious advantages among the latest reported g-C3N4 related photocatalysts. The morphology, structure and photocatalytic carrier dynamics of the photocatalyst are studied by a series of experimental characterizations.[GRAPHICS].
Fe-g-C3N4-catalyzed oxidation of benzene to phenol using hydrogen peroxide and visible light	A bioinspired iron-based catalyst with semiconductor photocatalytic functions in combination with a high surface area holds promise for synthetic chemistry via combining photocatalysis with organosynthesis. Here exemplified for phenol synthesis, Fe-g-C3N4/SBA-15 is able to oxidize benzene to phenol with H(2)O(2) even without the aid of strong acids or alkaline promoters. By taking advantage of both catalysis and photocatalysis functions of g-C3N4 nanoparticles, the yield of the phenol can be markedly promoted.
Time-Resolved Study on Xanthene Dye-Sensitized Carbon Nitride Photocatalytic Systems	Dye sensitization is a promising strategy to extend the visible light absorption of carbon nitride (C3N4) and increase the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution efficiency of C3N4 under visible light irradiation. However, the interaction dynamics between C3N4 and a sensitized dye has not been reported in the literature. Herein, we selected four commonly used xanthene dyes such as fluorescein, dibromofluorescein, eosin Y, and erythrosine B and prepared their corresponding dye-sensitized-C3N4 composites. For the first time, we derived the electron transfer rate from the LUMO of each photoexcited xanthene dye to the conduction band of C3N4 using picoesecond time-resolved fluorescence measurements. We also obtained the reduction potentials of all selected xanthene dyes and C3N4 with cyclic voltammetry measurements. The cyclic voltammetry measurements gave a consistent result with the picosecond time-resolved fluorescence measurements. Besides, the possibility of the selected xanthene dye as an acceptor for the hole of the photoexcited C3N4 was also discussed. We believe this study is significant for the researcher to understanding the fundamental aspects in the xanthene dye-sensitized-C3N4 photocatalytic systems.

Chemical modification with dihydro-4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate reveals the distance between K480 and K501 in the ATP-binding domain of the Na,K-ATPase	Dihydro-4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (H2DIDS) inactivates the renal Na,K-ATPase in an ATP- and K-preventable fashion; inactivation results in the covalent incorporation of a single [3H2]DIDS molecule into the Na pump alpha-subunit. K+ protection is observed at low concentrations (< 2 mM) and reversed at higher concentrations. The biphasic effect is also seen with Rb+, to a lesser extent by Cs+, and not at all by Na+ or choline. After extensive tryptic digestion of 3H2DIDS-inactivated enzyme, a single radiolabeled peptide is seen in 16.5% Tricine gels. N-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed two sequences 470IVEIPFNSTNxYQLS and 495HLLVMxGAPER, the unidentified residues were K480 and K501, respectively. These data provide suggestive evidence of cross-linking by H2DIDS between the two lysines. CNBr digestion of 3H2DIDS-labeled alpha-subunit produced a single radioactive band of the predicted 15-kDa mass for cross-linking between K480 an K501 produced by cleavage at known methione residues. The 15-kDa band combined two N-terminal sequences 464RDRYAKIVEI and 501xGAPERILDR which include K480 and K501. Thus K480 and K501 are within approximately 14 A of each other in the Na-bound form of the enzyme and information about the occupancy of the cation binding domain is transmitted to the ATP binding loop of the Na,K-ATPase.
Amino acid sequence of cytochrome c from Aspergillus niger	Cytochrome c from Aspergillus niger consists of two forms, a major one (80%) with 111 amino acid residues and a minor one (20%) with 108 residues, missing the three N-terminal residues of the major one. The primary sequence of A. niger cytochrome c was determined by standard spinning-cup Edman degradation of purified peptides and of pairs of peptides, from which the desired sequence was readily deduced by subtraction of common sequencies. Except for the extension and some variability at the N-terminal sequence, the A. niger protein conforms well with other cytochrome c structures.
In situ preparation of g-C3N4 nanosheet/FeOCl: Achievement and promoted photocatalytic nitrogen fixation activity	Climate change, global warming, and population growth have led researchers to use eco-sociable procedures for the N2 reduction reaction. It has discovered that N2 molecule can be transformed into NH3 in ambient circumstances with nanocomposites upon visible irradiation. In this research paper, a new visible-light-driven photocatalyst was constructed, with various weight percents of FeOCl particles (10, 20, 30, and 40%) that have adhered on NS-CN. Subsequently, multiple features of the nanocomposites were assayed in detail. The results illustrated that the NS-CN/FeOCl (20%) system has remarkable photoactivity in the NH4+ production reaction in comparison with the NS-CN and CN, which showed 2.5 and 8.6 higher activity, respectively. The durability of NS-CN/FeOCl (20%) system, as a substantial factor, was assayed for 5 recycles. Moreover, the effect of electron quenchers, pH of media, and solvent was studied. At last, a feasible Z-scheme mechanism for the remarkable improvement of N2 fixation efficiency was offered.

Carbon nitride/titania nanotubes composite for photocatalytic degradation of organics in water and sludge: Pre-treatment of sludge, anaerobic digestion Chock tor and biogas production	In this study, carbon nitride/titania nanotubes (C3N4/TiO2 NTs) composites were synthesized for the enhanced visible light mediated photocatalytic degradation and pre-treatment of wastewater sludge for enhanced biogas production. The co-existence of C3N4/TiO2 NTs and visible light activity was confirmed by XRD, TEM, UV-visible and PL spectroscopy. The photocatalytic performance of TiO2 NTs with 2% of melamine (precursor of C3N4), enhanced the degradation of 2-chlorophenol (2-CP) (k = 0.0176 min(-1)), where 96.6% removal was achieved at optimum pH 7.0 and 2-CP concentration of 30 mg/L. On the other hand, the application of C3N4/TiO2 NTs for solubilization of the rigid structure of sludge by photocatalysis released the soluble organics showing an improvement in sCOD production (4587 mg/L). Subsequently, anaerobic digestion of solubilized sludge has improved the methane production (723.4 ml kg(-1) VS) by 1.37 and 1.6 times compared to that in anaerobic digestion with photolytic and raw sludge, thus showing a promising applicability for biogas production from sludge and wastewater treatment.
Highly efficient visible-light driven photocatalytic reduction of CO2 over g-C3N4 nanosheets/tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin iron(III) chloride heterogeneous catalysts	Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into value-added chemicals is particularly attractive as it could produce renewable energy and capture greenhouse gas. Photoreduction of CO2 can be realized over molecular and inorganic catalysts. The former usually exhibit high activity, but low stability and often inactive under visible-light irradiation; the latter has low activity, but good stability. Here we use g-C3N4 nanosheets as the photosensitizer to integrate with Fe tetra(4-carboxylphenyl)porphyrin. chloride (FeTCPP) molecular catalyst. Besides pi-pi stacking between tri-s-triazine unit and porphyrin, the carboxyl group modified Fe porphyrin is used for the first time in CO2 photoreduction so as to form hydrogen bonding with the rich amino groups in g-C3N4 nanosheets. g-C3N4/FeTCPP heterogeneous catalysts are prepared via a facile self-assembly approach, in which light harvest is separated from catalysis spatially and temporally. The obtained g-C3N4/FeTCPP heterogeneous catalysts exhibit high activity for CO2 reduction under visible-light irradiation, with CO yield of 6.52 mmol g(-1) in 6 h and selectivity up to 98%. Fluorescence data indicate that the electrons can efficiently transfer from the g-C3N4 nanosheets to FeTCPP. The mechanism for CO2 reduction over the g-C3N4/FeTCPP heterogeneous catalysts is proposed based on the results of quasi in-situ ESR and UV-vis measurements. This work may pave a facile approach for fabricating the high-efficient photocatalysts for CO2 reduction, as well as better understanding the related mechanism.

Monodispersed and well-dispersed RhxP nanoparticles decorated on phosphorus-doped nitride carbon for efficient alkaline and acidic hydrogen evolution	Metal phosphides (MPs) synthesized by solid-state reaction have shown considerable potential in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from water splitting compared with that of Pt. However, large-sized MP nanoparticles (NPs) with irregular morphologies are inevitably achieved via the solid-state reaction with high-temperature calcination, which lead to the reduced availability of the active sites. Here, a simple and straightforward strategy was developed to synthesize monodispersed, uniformly distributed, and small RhxP NPs decorated on phosphorus-doped nitride carbon (PNC) via the pyrolysis of rhodium(III) chloride, triphenylphosphine, and melamine (RhxP/PNC-m). The RhxP/PNC-m that served as a HER electrocatalyst displayed excellent performance with the overpotentials of 24 and 27 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in basic and acidic solutions, respectively. This catalyst also showed good long-term stability in both media. The high-performance of RhxP/PNC-m should be attributed to the small, monodispersed, and highly distributed RhxP NPs on PNC support, which can supply abundant catalytically active sites for HER. The developed strategy for the synthesis of small RhxP NPs may offer new opportunities toward the electrochemical applications of other metal phosphides.
Boosting interfacial charge separation of Ba5Nb4O15/g-C3N4 photocatalysts by 2D/2D nanojunction towards efficient visible-light driven H-2 generation	To efficiently facilitate the charge transfer by constructing heterojunction photocatalysts is a promising strategy for improving solar-driven hydrogen generation. Herein, a novel 2D/2D nanojunction architecture of Ba5Nb4O15/g-C-3 N-4 photocatalysts with powerful interfacial charge transfer are rationally designed. Advanced electron microscopy analysis elucidates the layered hexagonal nanosheets were coupled on the surface of ultrathin g-C3N4 forming a 2D/2D nanojunction. More importantly, such characterizations and theoretical calculations together illustrate that a strong interfacial charge transfer existed between the g-C3N4 layer and Ba-O layer of the Ba5Nb4O15 nanosheets, which fostered the efficient transfer and provided more massive reactive centers for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The unique 2D/2D structure in Ba5Nb4O15/g-C-3 N-4 heterojunction leads to generate numerous charge transfer nanochannels, and which could accelerate the interfacial charge separation efficiency to a great extent. Ba5Nb4O15/g-C-3 N-4 (1:20) sample displayed a remarkable photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate (2.67 mmol h(-1) g(-1)) in oxalic acid solution, nearly 2.35 times higher than that of single g-C3N4 under visible light and exhibits an outstanding photostability even after four cycles. This work would provide a new insight for the design of 2D/2D heterojunction photocatalyst with efficient interfacial charge transfer and separation for solar-to-H-2 conversion.
Properties and mechanism of hexavalent chromium removal by FeS@ graphite carbon nitride nanocomposites	A novel nanocomposite, named as FCN, which was synthesized by loading FeS (Mackinawite) onto graphite phase carbon nitride (g-C3N4), was applied to remove Cr(VI) in aqueous solutions and characterized by SEM, BET, XRD, FTIR, Zeta and XPS. The effect of adsorption parameters including temperature, initial solution pH, FCN dosage, the initial concentration of Cr(VI), recycling performance of FCN and coexisting anions were investigated. Results revealed that the optimum adsorption capacity of the FCN for Cr(VI) was 61.8 mg/g at 298 K (pH=3). Inorganic anions such as SO42-, NO3- and Cl- exhibited positive effect, while HCO3- inhibited the adsorption of Cr(VI). The adsorption kinetics of Cr(VI) followed the pseudo-second-order model and the adsorption process fitted the Langmuir model well. Thermodynamic results showed that the reaction process of FCN for Cr(VI) adsorption was an endothermic process with increasing entropy. The main mechanism of removing Cr(VI) by FCN were adsorption, chemical reduction and complexation. These results reveal that FCN will be a potential material for removing Cr(VI) from aqueous solutions.
Microwave-assisted molten-salt rapid synthesis of isotype triazine-/heptazine based g-C3N4 heterojunctions with highly enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance	Rapid synthesis and construction of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) based heterojunctions, costeffective metal-free photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under solar irradiation, is of highly practical significance. This work reports a one-pot microwave-assisted molten-salt (mw-ms) process to rapidly synthesize isotype triazine-/heptazine based g-C3N4 heterojunctions with highly enhanced photocatalytic HER performance using melamine as the single-source precursor. The typical sample (mw-ms-g-C3N4) was obtained by thermally polymerizing melamine molecules at 550 degrees C for 30 min in the media of eutectic KCl/LiCI salts under microwave irradiation in air. The analyses of phases, chemical compositions and microstructures indicate that the mw-ms-g-C3N4 sample consists of an isotype triazine-/heptazine based g-C3N4 heterojunction, taking on a plate-like morphology with a specific surface area (S-BET) of 25.7 m(2) g(-1). Comparatively, the g-C3N4 sample synthesized via an electric-resistance molten-salt (er-ms) process at 550 degrees C for 240 min is composed of a triazine-based g-C3N4 phase with a SBET of 58.1 m(2) g-1, whereas the samples obtained by electric-resistance heating (er, at 550 degrees C for 240 min) and microwave heating (mw, at 550 degrees C for 30 min) processes consist of a heptazine-based g-C3N4 phase. The mw-ms-g-C3N4 sample shows a photocatalytic HER rate of 1480 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), which is 5 times that (300 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) of the er-ms-g-C3N4 sample, 15 times that (95 mu,mol h(-1)) of the er-g-C3N4 sample and 23 times that (63 mu mol h(-1)) of the mw-g-C3N4 sample, under the similar visible-light (lambda >= 420 nm) irradiation. The typical apparent quantum yield of the mw-ms-g-C3N4 sample at 420 nm is up to 10.7%. The UV-vis DR spectra suggest that both the triazine-based g-C3N4 and heptazine-based g-C3N4 phases have a similar bandgap of similar to 2.66 eV, whereas the Mott-Schottky analysis indicates that the triazine-based g-C3N4 phase has a more positive flat conductive potential (-0.90 V) than the triazine-based g-C3N4 phase (-1.22 V). Due to the suitable alignment of their energy bandgap structures, the isotype triazine-Theptazine based g-C3N4 hybrids in the mw-ms-g-C3N4 sample form a type II heterojunction of semiconductor/semiconductor, which provides a convenient carrier transfer path and leads to more efficient separation of photo-generated electron -hole pairs than the other samples. The synergistic effects of microwave heating and molten-salt liquid polycondensation provide a robust platform for rapid and large-scale construction of isotype g-C3N4/g-C3N4 heterojunctions as metal-free high-performance HER photocatalysts using a simple single-source precursor.

Self-Coupled g-C3N4 van der Waals Heterojunctions for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production	Constructing junctions can efficiently improve the photo-catalytic performance by suppressing the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and prolonging the lifetime of carriers. In this work, we exploited a facile method to fabricate g-C3N4 nanosheet (g-CNNS)/g-C3N4 nanofiber (g-CNNF) heterojunctional composites. The valence and conductive band offsets between g-CNNS and g-CNNF cause band bending, and van der Waals (vdW) heterojunctions are constructed at the interface of g-CNNS and g-CNNF. Because of the shorter diffusion distance of charge carriers and spontaneous electron motion, g-CNNS/g-CNNF vdW heterojunctions with intimate contact can effectively suppress the recombination of the photoexcited electron and hole and thus increase the carrier lifetime and further enhance the photocatalytic performance. Under the visible-light irradiation, these heterojunctions exhibit a 3 times higher photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 1375.9 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) compared with pristine g-CNNS. This work demonstrates that the fabricated vdW heterojunctions can effectively prolong the carrier lifetime through separating the photogenerated electron-hole pairs and provide a new perspective to design and develop the 2D photocatalysts with high charge-transfer efficiency.
High alkalinity boosts visible light driven H-2 evolution activity of g-C3N4 in aqueous methanol	A high rate of 2.23 mmol h(-1) g(-1) ( quantum efficiency of 6.67% at 400 nm) for visible light driven photocatalytic H-2 evolution can be achieved with g-C3N4 by alkalization of the solution to a pH of 13.3, due to accelerated transfer of photoholes to the sacrificial donor.
Fabrication of 2D SnS2/g-C3N4 heterojunction with enhanced H-2 evolution during photocatalytic water splitting	In this work, the 2D SnS2/g-C3N4 heterojunctions were successfully prepared by heating the homogeneous dispersion of SnS2 nanosheets and g-C3N4 nanosheets using a microwave muffle. SEM, TEM and HRTEM images indicated that the SnS2 nanosheets were loaded on the surface of the g-C3N4 nanosheets. The UV-vis spectra show that the absorption intensity of the as-prepared samples was increased and the absorption range was also extended from 420 nm to approximately 600 nm. The H-2 production rate over 5 wt% SnS2/g-C3N4 can reach 972.6 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1) under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm) using TEOA as the sacrifice agent and Pt as the electron trap, which is 2.9 and 25.6 times higher than those of the pristine g-C3N4 and SnS2, respectively. According to the obtained PL spectra, photocurrent and EIS spectra, the enhanced performance for H-2 generation over the heterojunctions is primarily ascribed to the rapid charge transfer arising from the suitable band gap positions leading to an improved photocatalytic performance. The recycling experiments indicated that the as-prepared composites exhibit good stability in H-2 production. Additionally, a possible enhanced mechanism for H-2 evolution was deduced based on the results obtained by various characterization techniques. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SYNTHESIS OF CARBON NITRIDE FILMS BY MAGNETICALLY ROTATED ARC-PLASMA JET CHEMICAL-VAPOR-DEPOSITION	Carbon Nitride films have been grown on nickel substrates by magnetically rotated arc-plasma jet chemical vapor deposition (CVD). These films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), wavelength dispersive X-ray spectrometry (WDS) transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Raman spectroscopy. Small grains (similar to 0.1 mu m) as well as nanocrystallites found in the films were identified to be beta-C3N4. Raman spectrum also confirmed the existence of beta-C3N4 phase in the films through three pronounced Raman bands at low frequency as expected from the Hooke's law approximation.
On the characteristics of solar radiative transfer and participating media in Harbin, China	The ultimate solar radiation received by solar systems is the result of being absorbed and scattered by aerosols, and it is mainly influenced by the geometric structure and composition of the aerosol particles, which can be determined by the formation process. Samples of atmospheric aerosol particles were collected in Harbin from February to April 2019. Gravimetric analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and liquid phase ion chromatography were used to analyze the morphology, mixed structure, and water-soluble ion physicochemical properties of particulate samples. The results showed that the average concentration of particulate matter in dust weather was 648.31 mu g/m(3). The main mixed structure was an external mixed structure, accounting for 58%, and the mass concentration of water-soluble ions accounted for similar to 3.6% of the total suspended particles. In haze weather, the average concentration of particulate matter was 319.90 mu g/m(3) and the main mixed structure was a core-shell structure, accounting for 60%. The mass concentration of water-soluble ions accounted for similar to 11.9% of the total suspended particles. (C) 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)
CHARACTERIZATION OF CARBON NITRIDE NANOPARTICLES PREPARED BY LASER ABLATION IN LIQUID FOR OPTOELECTRONIC APPLICATION	In this work, carbon nitride (C3N4) nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by pulse laser ablation of graphite in ammonium solution, and deposited on silicon substrates by spray. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UV-visible spectrophotometer and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to study bonding, absorption, size and morphology of the produce NPs. The FTIR absorption peaks at 2121.6, 1631.7 and 1384 cm(-1) stretching vibration bond, it is inferred for the C  N, C=N and C-N, respectively. Bonds suggests the formation, C3N4 NPs. UV absorption peaks coincide with the electronic transitions corresponding to the formation, C3N4 NPs with 3.98 eV optical bandgap. The TEM show the aggregation of the C3N4 NPs with size ranges from 4 to 83 nm, and also the leaf-like structure are shown in the structure of C3N4 suspension. High performance rectifying C3N4/Si heterojunction with a rectifying ratio exceeding 345 at V = 5V was obtained, with high photoresponsivity of 2.33A/W at 600 nm. The results show that C3N4 NPs on silicon substrates will act as very good candidates for making high efficiency photodiodes.

Electrochemical Detection of Uric Acid on Exfoliated Nanosheets of Graphitic-Like Carbon Nitride (g-C3N4) Based Sensor	A highly sensitive, selective and stable electrochemical sensor for detection of uric acid (UA) in aqueous solution has been successfully developed by deposition of exfoliated graphitic-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets on glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The synthesized g-C3N4 was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopies. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) were used to investigate the crystalline structure of g-C(3)N4(.) The elemental composition was characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS). Compared to bare GCE, exfoliated g-C3N4 nanosheets (NS) modified GCE exhibited higher catalytic current for UA electrooxidation at reduced over potential in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS), which is essential to discriminate interfering analytes. g-C(3)N4 NS modified GCE showed a linear relationship between the electrochemical signal and the UA concentration from 100 to 1000 mu M with fast response by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The common interferent molecules such as dopamine, ascorbic acid, folic acid, paracetamol, lactic acid, oxalic acid, cysteine, and ciprofloxacin were tested in 0.1 MPBS for the g-C3N4 NS modified GCE. It was found that these molecules did not affect the oxidation current of UA when they co-existed in the same buffer solution. Moreover, the modified sensor probe was tested for UA in urine samples with satisfactory recovery values. The proposed sensor offers high accuracy, sensitivity, simple fabrication and low cost. We suggest that g-C3N4 NS based sensor can be useful for UA analysis in medical, environmental, food and industrial applications. (C) The Author(s) 2019. Published by ECS.
Fabrication of 2D/0D Heterojunction Based on the Dual Controls of Micro/Nano-Morphology and Structure Towards High-Efficiency Photocatalytic H-2 Production	It is a keen interest to fabricate heterojunction among semiconductors with different dimensions for improving the photocatalytic performance. Herein, the 2D/0D up-g-C3N4/Ni12P5 heterojunctions were prepared by means of anchoring Ni12P5 nanodots on the surface of ultrathin porous carbon nitride (up-g-C3N4) nanosheets based on the dual control strategy of micro/nano- morphology and structure. The prepared 2D/0D up-g-C3N4/Ni12P5 heterojunctions exhibit the far more outstanding photocatalytic H-2 production activity in comparison with the up-g-C3N4, up-g-C3N4/Pt-3 % and u-g-C3N4/Ni12P5-3 % samples and the superior cycle stability. The prominent photocatalytic H-2 production activity and stability originate from the improved visible light harvest ability and separation efficiency of charge carriers owing to the modification effect of Ni12P5 nanodots as cocatalysts on the surface of up-g-C3N4 nanosheets through forming the Ni-N bond states.
Soft and hard templates assisted synthesis mesoporous CuO/g-C(3)N(4 )heterostructures for highly enhanced and accelerated Hg(II) photoreduction under visible light	Herein, triblock copolymer surfactant (F127) and mesoporous silica (MCM-41) as soft and hard templates were employed to synthesize of mesoporous CuO/g-C(3)N(4 )heterostructures with large surface areas for Hg (II) photoreduction in existence of formic acid as a holes sacrificial. TEM image for mesoporous CuO/g-C3N4  indicated that CuO NPs are homogeneously distributed with spherical shape in particle size similar to 5 nm onto the surface of g-C3N4 . Mesoporous 2%CuO/g-C(3)N(4 )heterostructure was achieved a high Hg (II) photoreduction rate of 628.74 mu molg (1)h (1) and high photoreduction efficiency of similar to 100% within 50 min compared with the pure either mesoporous CuO NPs (130.11 mu molg (1)h (1 ), 21%) and g-C3N4  (88.54 mu molg (1)h (1) ,14%). The highest Hg(II) photoreduction rate achieved was 628.74 timolg (1)h (1) , which is 4.83 and 7.1 magnitudes stronger than mesoporous CuO NPs and g-C3N4. The excellent photocatalytic performance of mesoporous CuO/g-C3N4  heterostructures for Hg(II) photoreduction is referred to highly dispersed mesoporous CuO NPs with small particle size onto g-C3N4, narrow bandgap, large surface area, a rapid transfer of Hg(II) ions and HCOOH to easily reach the active sites due to the facile penetration through the mesostructure, thus promoting the utilization of porous structure of CuO/g-C3N4  heterostructures for efficient diffusion of Hg(II) ions. The intense interaction between mesoporous CuO NPs and porous g-C3N4  confirms the durability of the CuO/g-C3N4  heterostructures during recyclability for five times. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Simultaneous enhancement of thermal conductivity and flame retardancy for epoxy resin thermosets through self-assemble of ammonium polyphosphate surface with graphitic carbon nitride	Conferring the flame retardant performance and thermal conductivity simultaneously for epoxy resin (EP) thermosets was significant for fire safety and thermal management applications of electrical and electronic devices. Herein, the graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with desired amount was assembled on the surface of ammonium polyphosphate (APP), and the obtained APP/g-C3N4 (CN-APP) was characterized and confirmed by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy tests, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. CN-APP was incorporated into EP and then cured with m-phenylenediamine. The thermal conductive value of EP/CN-APP thermosets achieved 1.09 W center dot mK(-1), and the samples achieved UL-94 V-0 grade during vertical burning tests with the limiting oxygen index of 30.1% when 7 wt% CN-APP with the mass fraction of APP/g-C3N4 of 9/1 was incorporated. For comparative investigation, equal amount of individual g-C3N4 was introduced into EP thermosets, and the thermal conductivity was only 0.4 W center dot mK(-1). Compared with pure EP, the addition of CN-APP enhanced the glass transition temperature of EP/CN-APP thermosets and promoted the generation of more expanded, coherent, and compact char layer during combustion. Consequently, the heat release and smoke production of EP/CN-APP thermosets were greatly suppressed and led to the improvement of fire safety of materials. It was an alternative and promising approach for preparing high-performance polymeric materials especially used in integrated electronic devices.
Autonomous self-healing supramolecular elastomer reinforced and toughened by graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets tailored for smart anticorrosion coating applications	Intrinsic self-healing materials possessing the capability to autonomously repair their structure and functionalities upon mechanical damage have attracted great attention. Up to now, despite intense research in this area, the synthesis of intrinsic self-healing materials with a simultaneous combination of stiffness, strength and toughness is still a huge challenge. Herein, inspired by nature, we prepared a novel poly(urea-urethane)-graphitic carbon nitride nanosheet (PUU-g-C3N4 NS) composite material, in which the multiple hydrogen bonds within the PUU matrix endow the composite material with room temperature self-healing ability, and g-C3N4 NSs, serving as both chemical and physical cross-linkers, provide the composite material with significantly improved mechanical properties. The PUU-g-C3N4 NS material was subsequently deposited onto the surface of aluminum alloy 2024 as a smart anticorrosion coating (AC) by the drop-casting method for protection. The anticorrosion performance as well as the self-healing ability of the PUU-g-C3N4 NS AC was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, laser microscopy and scanning Kelvin probe technology. The experimental results show that the PUU-g-C3N4 NS AC maintained its protective capability even after immersion in 0.5 M NaCl for 20 days. Moreover, an artificial scratch on the surface of the PUU-g-C3N4 NS AC was observed to vanish and the regenerated anticorrosion ability in the damage area was gained after healing for only 10 min. The introduction of g-C3N4 NSs makes the PUU-g-C3N4 NS composite material meet the applicable requirements forAC, offers the composite coating excellent anti-penetration ability and retains the satisfactory autonomous self-healing function under ambient conditions, even under high humidity.
Engineering of Z-scheme 2D/3D architectures with Ni(OH)(2) on 3D porous g-C3N4 for efficiently photocatalytic H-2 evolution	The construction of Z-scheme system to achieve efficient photolysis of water to produce hydrogen is a promising approach in the field of photocatalysis. In this work, two dimensionally (2D) crystallized Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets are loaded upon the surfaces of three dimensionally macroporous g-C3N4 (3D g-C3N4) via the electrostatic method, synthesizing 2D/3D Ni(OH)(2)/g-C3N4 (Ni/DOMCN) Z-scheme system. The optimized photocatalysts exhibit apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 8.2% at 400 nm and an excellent H-2-production rate of (similar to)87.2 mu mol h(-1) under visible light (lambda > 400 nm), which is (similar to)76 times higher than unmodified 3D g-C3N4. The excellent cyclic performance of optimized photocatalyst can be attributed to the redox process between Ni2+/Ni-0/NiO during the photocatalytic reaction. The advantages of modified photocatalysts are attributed to the following aspects: (1) The Z-scheme system, accelerating the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and leading to more efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production; (2) 2D/3D hollow structures, facilitating the diffusion of the solution and the light reflections; (3) tight contact, promoting the transfer and separation of photogenerated charge carrier; (4) larger surface area, providing more reactive sites. This work highlights the critical role of the Z-scheme system in solar photolysis and provides new insights into the development of 2D/3D photocatalysts.
In-situ hard template synthesis of mesoporous carbon/graphite carbon nitride (C/CN-T-x) composites with high photocatalytic activities under visible light irridation	Carbon/graphite carbon nitride (C/CN-T-x) hybrid composites with high photocatalytic activities under visible light irradiation were synthesized by an in-situ hard template method using the partially formaldehyde-modified dicyandiamide (PFMD) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as the precursors and template, respectively. The structures of the as-prepared composites were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), elemental analysis, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The composite prepared under the optimal conditions exhibits the large surface area of 174 m(2). g(-1) and high photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible light irradiation. The significant improvement in photocatalytic activity of the composite, as compared with the pure graphite carbon nitride (CN), is attributed to the large surface area, strong dye adsorption ability and enhanced separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.
Fe-ZrO2 imbedded graphene like carbon nitride for acarbose (ACB) photo-degradation intermediate study	Fe-ZrO2 imbedded g-C3N4 was successfully prepaid by solvo-thermal method for the photo-degradation of anti-diabetic drug, acarbose (ACB). The synthesized material were characterized with the help of FT-IR-Spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, UV-vis-Spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, HPLC-MS and scanning electron microscopy. These characterization results indicated that the target materials was well prepared and photo-catalytically active. The target catalyst (Fe-ZrO2/g-C3N4) showed very high photo-degradation rate against acarbose (ACB) and rhodamine (RhB). Presence of heterojunction between FZ and GCN increased the surface area and light absorbance capability. HPLC-MS scrutiny indicated that photo-degradation process, under visible light, split the ACB into lot of intermediates and finally degraded completely.

Efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production by Mn0.05Cd0.95S nanoparticles anchored on cubic NiSe2	In the field of catalysis, three critical factors for evaluating catalyst activity include charge separation efficiency, photoabsorption, and surface activity sites. In this work, we designed novel effective Mn0.05Cd0.95S/NiSe(2)photocatalysts, which were formed by Mn0.05Cd0.95S (MCS) nanoparticles anchored on the outer surface of cubic NiSe2. The optimum hydrogen evolution rate of the Mn0.05Cd0.95S/NiSe(2)composite is 14.3 mmol h(-1)g(-1), which is 7.5 times higher than that of single Mn0.05Cd0.95S. Multiple characterization techniques (XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, PL,etc.) were performed to research the properties of the composite catalyst and propose a possible mechanism for hydrogen production by NiSe2/Mn0.05Cd0.95S. Structural analyses and experimental results reveal that attaching MCS particles to the surface of NiSe(2)can significantly increase the visible light absorption capacity. Cubic NiSe(2)can efficiently facilitate the separation of electron-hole pairs and expose abundant active sites for photocatalytic redox reactions. This work demonstrates that low-cost NiSe(2)is a promising co-catalyst for the photocatalytic splitting of water to produce hydrogen.
The primary structure of mu-chain-disease protein BOT. Peculiar amino-acid sequence of the N-terminal 42 positions	The complete primary structure of the mu heavy-chain disease (mu-HCD) protein BOT has been determined. The monomeric HCD-mu-chain consists of 391 amino-acid residues, lacking the VH and mu CH1 domains but including the entire CH2, CH3 and CH4 domains (349 residues). The sequence of the preceding 42 N-terminal residues which we designate as the "pre-C-part" presents no homology to any known variable or constant immunoglobulin sequence, but contains an internal homology of positions 10-19 to positions 20-29. The origin of the "pre-C-part" structure and the deletion of the mu CH1 domain of protein BOT are discussed.
Functionalized g-C3N4 sheets assisted synthesis of growth-oriented MIL-88B-Fe with rod-like structure: Upgrading framework photo-catalytic performance and stability	
A Cost-Effective Solid-State Approach to Synthesize g-C3N4 Coated TiO2 Nanocomposites with Enhanced Visible Light Photocatalytic Activity	Novel graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) coated TiO2 nanocomposites were prepared by a facile and cost-effective solid-state method by thermal treatment of the mixture of urea and commercial TiO2. Because the C3N4 was dispersed and coated on the TiO2 nanoparticles, the as-prepared g-C3N4/TiO2 nanocomposites showed enhanced absorption and photocatalytic properties in visible light region. The as-preparedg-C3N4 coated TiO2 nanocomposites under 450 degrees C exhibited efficient visible light photocatalytic activity for degradation of aqueous MB due to the increased visible light absorption and enhanced MB adsorption. The g-C3N4 coated TiO2 nanocomposites would have wide applications in both environmental remediation and solar energy conversion.
The precursor of sulfatide activator protein is processed to three different proteins	The enzymic degradation of a number of sphingolipids in the lysosomes is stimulated by small acid glycoproteins named activator proteins. We purified and sequenced a new protein, called component C, which seems to be related to sulfatide activator and to a recently described activator of glucosylceramidase (A1 activator) (Kleinschmidt, T., Christomanou, H. & Braunitzer, G. (1987) Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler 368, 1571-1578). It consists of 78 amino acids and carries one carbohydrate chain at aparagine 20. Component C shows 21.5% sequence homology to sulfatide activator and 34.2% homology to A1 activator. Structural similarities between these three proteins have also been detected. Recently the cDNA sequence of the sulfatide activator precursor has been published (Dewji, N.N., Wenger, D.A. & O'Brien, J.S. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 8652-8656). We could align the protein sequences of sulfatide activator, A1 activator and component C with that of this large precursor protein. After minor corrections of the DNA sequence we obtained total fit. Thus it seems that three different proteins are derived from the sulfatide activator precursor by proteolytic processing. Possible processing sites were found on the precursor at sites adjacent to the N-termini and C-termini of the mature proteins. The processing of sulfatide activator was studied by Fujibayashi and Wenger (Fujibayashi, S. & Wenger, D.A. (1986) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 875, 554-562). Their data support our assumption that processing occurs by simultaneous cleavage at all possible sites.
Artificial photosynthetic hydrogen evolution over g-C3N4 nanosheets coupled with cobaloxime	We report an economic and noble-metal-free artificial photosynthetic system, consisting of g-C3N4 as a photosensitizer and a photocatalyst, and cobaloxime as a co-catalyst, for H-2 generation. This system allows for effective electron transfer fromexcited g-C3N4 to Co-III(dmgH)(2)pyCl to generate reduced cobaloxime intermediate species for efficient H2 evolution. Transient fluorescence studies reveal that the presence of cobaloxime and TEOA promotes the population of excited electrons to transfer from g-C3N4, which is responsible for the high photocatalytic activity of this g-C3N4-cobaloxime conjugation system.
Magnetic and Photocatalytic Curcumin Bound Carbon Nitride Nanohybrids for Enhanced Glioma Cell Death	A mesoporous magnetic nanohybrid functionalized with 14 wt % carbon nitride (CN) and loaded with curcumin (Cur) has been developed as a combination platform for photodynamic therapy and magnetic hyperthermia. CN-Cur complexes on the nanoparticle surface facilitate fast charge separation of hole-electron pairs under blue LED light irradiation and subsequent singlet oxygen generation. Cur release from the nanoparticle was significant only when exposed to both lysosomal pH (pH = 5.2) and an alternating current magnetic field (AMF). The mesoporous magnetic carbon nitride (MMCN) caused a 350% increase in the level of intracellular ROS as compared to the light exposed untreated control group. The nanohybrid was non-hemolytic and found to be biocompatible with HUVEC cells at concentrations up to 360 μg/mL. A similar concentration under AMF exposure caused a localized temperature rise of 4.2 °C and resulted in a 60% reduction in C6 cell viability. The cancer cell death further increased up to 80% under sequential exposure to light and AMF. The combinatorial treatment exerted significant cytoskeletal and nuclear damage in the cancer cells as assessed by confocal microscopy. The nanohybrid also exhibited relaxivity of 88 mM-1 s-1, imparting significant T2 weighted contrast to the cancer cells.
Simulation for thermal processing of amorphous carbon nitride	A simulation model is established to study the amorphous structure of carbon nitride under thermal processing. The method of our simulation involves the consideration of material cohesive energy, which can determine the configuration of atoms in the matrix. The thermal treatment of the material is considered as a Markov process with a transition possibility determined by Gibbs distribution. Upon the simulated structure of amorphous carbon nitride matrix, the bulk modulus of the material can be calculated. More detailed study such as sp(3)/sp(2) ratio of carbon and nitrogen vibration density spectra of the material can be calculated by counting atoms with different type and vibration frequency. The influence of an annealing process on the properties of amorphous carbon nitride has been shown. According to our simulation, annealing can increase the number of sp(2) hybridised carbon atoms and lower the bulk modulus. The simulation method can provide a way to study the novel material properties and the results can help experimentalists design their synthesis process.
Photoactivity of g-C3N4/S-Doped Porous Carbon Composite: Synergistic Effect of Composite Formation	A composite of g-C3N4 with visible-light photoactive S-doped carbon was synthesized. Synergistic effects in surface chemistry and electrical conductivity, and a decrease in the band gap (E-g, estimated from optical measurements) from 2.91 eV for g-C3N4 to 2.79 eV for the composite were found. Both the carbon and the composite showed photosensitivity but only the composite revealed a visible-light-driven reduction activity.
Three-dimensional magnetic graphitic carbon nitride composites as high-performance adsorbent for removal Pb2+ from aqueous solution	Three-Dimensional magnetic nanocomposite (Fe3O4@g-C3N4) was first prepared and used to removal Pb2+ from aqueous solution by adsorption method. Various of techniques were used to character Fe3O4@g-C3N4 such as scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TGA). Batch experiments with different pH, initial concentration, contact time and ionic strength were used to evaluate the adsorption performance of Fe3O4@g-C3N4. The adsorption kinetics data followed pseudo-second-order model. The isothermal adsorption equilibrium data were best described by Langmuir model and predicated adsorption capacity was 423.73 mg g(-1) for Pb2+. The result of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectrum suggested that the main adsorption mechanism of Fe3O4@g-C3N4 for Pb2+ is the coordination between conjugated pi-electron pairs of heptazine (C6N7) units or triazine ring (C3N3) units and sp(2) C-N with metal ions. By comparing the adsorption capacities of Fe3O4, g-C3N4 and Fe3O4@g-C3N4, it can be found that the adsorption capacity of g-C3N4 would increase by increasing the layer spacing. Fe3O4@g-C3N4 could be regenerated by HNO3 and the adsorption capacity of regenerative Fe3O4@g-C3N4 could maintain 89.3% after five cycles. The adsorption capacity of Fe3O4@g-C3N4 for Pb2+ is 121.42 mg g(-1) in acid electrolytic zinc residue percolate, Therefore, the Fe3O4@g-C3N4 is a potential adsorbent for removing Pb2+ from wastewater.

A facile microwave stimulated g-C3N4/-Fe2O3 hybrid photocatalyst with superior photocatalytic activity and attractive cycling stability	In this report, we successfully fabricate the ratio-perfect g-C3N4/-Fe2O3 hybrid nanocomposites by regulating the mass ratio between two components via a facile one step hydrothermal route. The hybrid catalysts were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), photoluminescence and Brunauer-emmett-teller (BET). The photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4/-Fe2O3 for decolorization of congo-red (CR) and malachite green (MG) was evaluated. The results show that g-C3N4/-Fe2O3 composites exhibit higher photocatalytic performance than the pure g-C3N4 under simulated visible light irradiation. The results demonstrate that g-C3N4/-Fe2O3 with 1:2 mass ratios shows the optimal overall photocatalytic performance such as huge degradation efficiency (95%) towards MG dye. The enhanced photocatalytic activity could be due to the suited band structure and close contact interfaces between g-C3N4 and -Fe2O3, which lead to the efficient transfer and separation of the photogenerated charge carriers. The improved photocatalytic mechanism of the hybrid g-C3N4/-Fe2O3 hybrid catalysts was also proposed.
Enzymes Immobilized on Carbon Nitride (C3N4) Cooperating with Metal Nanoparticles for Cascade Catalysis	The exploration of effective platforms for immobilizing chemo- and biocatalysts to develop biohybrid catalysts is an attractive subject of practical interest. In this work, carbon nitride (C3N4) is used for the first time as a platform for the immobilization of metal catalyst (Pd nanoparticles) and biocatalyst (Candida antarctica lipase B, CalB) in a facile manner to prepare biohybrid catalyst. The optimal biohybrid catalyst inherits the intrinsic performance of both Pd nanoparticles and CalB, and shows high activity in the one-pot cascade reaction converting benzaldehyde to benzyl hexanoate at room temperature. With this proof of concept, it is expected that C3N4 can be utilized for immobilizing more types of chemo- and biocatalysts for perspective applications.
Template-free synthesis of oxygen-containing ultrathin porous carbon quantum dots/g-C3N4 with superior photocatalytic activity for PPCPs remediation	The development of facile and environmentally compatible synthetic strategies for broad-spectrum response photocatalysts is a primary goal for researchers in this area. For this study, we report on a template-free thermal treatment strategy for the synthesis of an oxygen-containing ultrathin porous carbon quantum dots/polymeric carbon nitride metal-free composites (CQD/OUPCN). Morphology characterization revealed that the thermal treatment induced bulk CQD/g-C3N4 (CQD/BCN) to transform to porous ultrathin 2D nanosheets with a high specific surface area. Chemical structure characterization revealed that O atoms were involved in the chemical composition of C3N4 following the introduction of CQD and subsequent thermal treatment. Optical and electrical characterization, as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations, confirmed that the introduction of O atoms and CQD enabled the tuning of the intrinsic electronic state, and improved the charge transfer capacity of C3N4. Together with the up-converted fluorescence properties of CQD, the CQD/OUPCN exhibited remarkable broad-spectrum activity toward the degradation of PPCPs. Under visible light irradiation, the CQD/OUPCN-0.5% showed an 18.5 fold higher indomethacin (IDM) degradation rate than did g-C3N4. Further kinetics studies, including reactive species (RS) and degradation intermediate detection, indicated that RS, particularly O-2(-), was generated during the photocatalytic process, which could lead to the decomposition, and finally mineralization of IDM.
Graphene-bridged Z-type silver phosphate/G/carbon nitride photocatalyst used for visible light catalysis of methyl orange or water decomposition to produce oxygen, comprises silver phosphate, carbon nitride, and G charge transporter	
WX y /g-C3N4 (WX y =W 2 C, WS 2 , or W 2 N) Composites for Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Water Splitting	The development of earth-abundant, economical, and efficient photocatalysts to boost water splitting is a key challenge for the practical large-scale application of hydrogen energy. In this study, g-C3 N4 loaded with different tungsten compounds (W2 C, WS2 , and W2 N) is found to exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activities. W2 C/g-C3 N4 displays the highest activity for the photocatalytic reaction with a H2 evolution rate of up to 98 μmol h-1 , as well as remarkable recycling stability. The excellent photocatalytic activity of W2 C/g-C4 N3 is attributed to the suitable band alignment in W2 C/g-C4 N3 and high HER activity of the W2 C cocatalyst, which promotes the separation and transfer of carriers and hydrogen evolution at the surface. These findings demonstrate that the tungsten carbide cocatalyst is more active for the photocatalytic reaction than the sulfide or nitride, paving a way for the design of novel and efficient carbides as cocatalysts for photocatalysis.
Effective catalytic hydrodechlorination of chlorophenoxyacetic acids over Pd/graphitic carbon nitride	Catalytic hydrodechlorination (HDC) of chlorophenoxyacetic acids was performed over Pd/graphitic carbon nitride (Pd/g-C3N4) catalysts in the present work. A series of Pd/g-C3N4 catalysts were prepared by a deposition-precipitation method, and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N-2 adsorption-desorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), CO chemisorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Pd/g-C3N4 catalysts showed excellent activity to convert dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) into phenoxyacetic acid (PA) and the catalytic activity was correlated with the ratio of Pd2+/(Pd-0 + Pd2+) and Pd particle size. In addition, HDC of 2,4-D over Pd/g-C3N4 catalyst followed the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model, indicating an adsorption-controlled mechanism. Other chlorophenoxyacetic acids, such as 2-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (2-CPA), 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (4-CPA) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) could also be completely dechlorinated to PA over Pd/g-C3N4 catalysts.

This model is based on a new carbon vacancy order leading to an orthorhombic cell. The space group and the atomic positions are described. The experimental X-ray diffraction is indexed using this new model. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.
Investigation of type I and type III collagens of the lung in progressive systemic sclerosis	The interstitial collagens, type I and type III, were investigated in lung tissue from patients with progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) with pulmonary involvement. By use of CNBr digestion of whole tissue, the relative content of type I versus type III collagen was unchanged. This contrasts with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Limited pepsin digestion released greater amounts of collagen (55%) than normal (16%), but the individual collagen chains were chemically indistinguishable. A reduced amount of the more stable collagen crosslink, hydroxylysinonorleucine, was observed which was consistent with the relatively greater degree of solubilization.
Facile preparation of Mg-doped graphitic carbon nitride composites as a solid base catalyst for Knoevenagel condensations	Mg-doped graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) composites were prepared using a facile thermal polymerization process under air atmosphere. The obtained materials can be employed as the solid base catalysts in Knoevenagel condensation reactions. The Mg-doped g-C3N4 composites show excellent performance as a solid catalyst and superior catalytic activity compared to the pure CN-U. The introduction of Mg species improved the overall basic property of CN-U, favoring Knoevenagel condensations. The 5MgCN-U catalyst exhibited high benzaldehyde conversion of 97.4% at 70 A degrees C and good cycling stability for four cycles, with 87.7% benzaldehyde conversion and nearly 100% benzylidene malononitrile selectivity. Additionally, the Mg-doped g-C3N4 composites from urea showed superior catalytic performance than those produced from dicyandiamide and melamine, indicating that the precursors contribute to the efficiency of Knoevenagel condensation reactions.
Photodegradation of rhodamine B and methyl orange over boron-doped g-C3N4 under visible light irradiation	Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and boron-doped g-C3N4 were prepared by heating melamine and the mixture of melamine and boron oxide, respectively. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and UV-vis spectra were used to describe the properties of as-prepared samples. The electron paramagnetic resonance was used to detect the active species for the photodegradation reaction over g-C3N4. The photodegradation mechanisms for two typical dyes, rhodamine B (Rh B) and methyl orange (MO), are proposed based on our comparison experiments. In the g-C3N4 photocatalysis system, the photodegradation of Rh B and MO is attributed to the direct hole oxidation and overall reaction, respectively; however, for the MO photodegradation the reduction process initiated by photogenerated electrons is a major photocatalytic process compared with the oxidation process induced by photogenerated holes. Boron doping for g-C3N4 can promote photodegradation of Rh B because the boron doping improves the dye adsorption and light absorption of catalyst.
A facile synthesis method for fabrication of LaFeO3/g-C3N4 nanocomposite as efficient visible-light-driven photocatalyst for photodegradation of RhB and 4-CP	The objective of this paper was to prepare, characterize and evaluate the degradation efficiency of organic pollutants on a perovskite-type LaFeO3-coupled graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) photocatalyst under visible light irradiation. The photocatalyst was synthesized by a simple calcination method. The physical and photophysical properties of the LaFeO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst with various weight ratios of LaFeO3 were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherm measurement, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, and electrochemical measurements. According to the flat band potential estimated by the Mott-Schottky plot and the optical band gap measurements, both semiconductors (LaFeO3 and g-C3N4) can absorb visible light and have band edge positions that allow the transfer of photoelectrons from g-C3N4 to LaFeO3. As compared to g-C3N4, the C 1s and N 1s peaks of the LaFeO3/g-C3N4 composite showed an obvious shift to lower binding energy, implying the existence of a synergistic effect between g-C3N4 and LaFeO3. Furthermore, photocurrent measurement and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed the higher photo-induced charge carrier separation efficiency of the LaFeO3/g-C3N4 composite. The results show that the visible light activity of the composite photocatalyst LaFeO3/g-C3N4 for the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) is higher than that of pure LaFeO3 and g-C3N4, respectively. However, the main reason for the enhanced activity was attributed to the interfacial transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes between LaFeO3 and g-C3N4, leading to the effective charge separation in the composite, inhibited recombination of electron-hole pairs and, finally, enhanced photocatalytic performance of the composite. It was found that the holes, hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) and superoxide radical ions (O-2(-)) are the main reactive species in the degradation reaction of RhB and 4-CP over the LaFeO3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst. More importantly, on the basis of the estimated conduction band (CB) from the Mott-Schottky plots, LaFeO3 and the composite show no activity toward hydrogen production under visible light. This work can be applied for the production of other visible-light-responsive photocatalysts based on g-C3N4 that have potential in environmental purification applications.
Tetracycline Removal Under Solar Illumination Over Ag 3 VO 4 /mpg-C3N4 Heterojunction Photocatalysts	Ag3 VO4 /mpg-C3 N4 (mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride) heterojunction photocatalysts were prepared by anchoring tiny Ag3 VO4 particles on the nanosheet of mpg-C3 N4 . The prepared Ag3 VO4 /mpg-C3 N4 heterojunctions were used to remove tetracycline (TC), a kind of antibiotics widely released into the aquatic environment under solar irradiation. Compared with pure mpg-C3 N4 and Ag3 VO4 , Ag3 VO4 /mpg-C3 N4 displayed much higher photocatalytic activity (83.2% removal rate within 90 min under visible-light irradiation). Importantly, no apparent deactivation was observed for Ag3 VO4 /mpg-C3 N4 -40 after five cycles, inferring a good reusability. As confirmed by photocurrent measurement and photoluminescence spectra, the excellent photocatalytic property of Ag3 VO4 /mpg-C3 N4 was credit to the electron-hole separation enhancement at the formed heterojunction of two semiconductors. In addition, a possible mechanism and intermediate products for the Ag3 VO4 /mpg-C3 N4 photocatalysts toward the photodegradation of TC in aqueous solution under artificial sunlight radiation were proposed based on the scavengers trapping test, ESR spectra and a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with mass spectrometer (MS) analysis. This investigation provides a low cost, green and easily practical approach to remove the antibiotics in the aquatic environment.
Microinfiltration of Mg(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O into g-C3N4 and macroencapsulation with commercial sealants: A two-step method to enhance the thermal stability of inorganic composite phase change materials	
In-situ fabrication of g-C3N4/MIL-68(In)-NH2 heterojunction composites with enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity for degradation of ibuprofen	For the first time, visible-light-driven g-C3N4/MIL-68(In)-NH2 heterojunction composites with high photocatalytic activity were prepared for the degradation of ibuprofen (IBP) using an in-situ solvothermal synthesis method assisted with ultrasonication. The composites achieved intensive visible-light absorption, enhanced separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, and high adsorption capacity, thus achieving excellent photocatalytic degradation for IBP. Among all the composites, 10 wt% g-C3N4/MIL-68(In)-NH2 exhibited the maximum photocatalytic rate (0.01739 min(-1)), 19.28 and 2.00 times higher than those of g-C3N4 and MIL-68(In)-NH2, respectively. Moreover, the pH, ibuprofen concentration, and catalyst dosages played important roles both in photodegradation and adsorption. In addition, the photocatalytic mechanism was also elucidated, demonstrating that h(+) was the main reactive species, followed by center dot OH and center dot O-2(-) radicals, responsible for the degradation of IBP. Finally, seven aromatic intermediates of IBP were identified, and five possible degradation pathways were proposed, mainly involving hydroxylation, aldehyde oxidation, decarboxylation, and dehydrogenization reactions.
Fluorescence quenching of carbon nitride nanosheet through its interaction with DNA for versatile fluorescence sensing	This work investigates the interaction of carbon nitride nanosheet (CNNS), a recently developed two-dimensional nanomaterial, with DNA and its fluorescence quenching mechanism on fluorophore labeled single-stranded DNA probes. The static quenching through the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the excited fluorophore to the conductive band of CNNS is identified. Utilizing the affinity change of CNNS to DNA probes upon their recognition to targets and the PET-based fluorescence quenching effect, a universal sensing strategy is proposed for design of several homogeneous fluorescence detection methods with short assay time and high sensitivity. This strategy is versatile and can be combined with different amplification tools for quick fluorescence sensing of DNA and extensive DNA related analytes such as metal cations, small molecules, and proteins. As examples, two simple fluorescence detection methods for DNA and Hg(2+), one facile detection method coupled with Exo III-mediated target recycling for sensitive DNA analysis, and a ratiometric fluorescence protocol for DNA detection are proposed. This work provides an avenue for understanding the interaction between two-dimensional nanomaterials and biomolecules and designing novel sensing strategies for extending the applications of nanomaterials in bioanalysis.
The Influence of Carbon Nitride Nanosheets Doping on the Crystalline Formation of MIL-88B(Fe) and the Photocatalytic Activities	In this research, bulk graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3 N4 ) is exfoliated and transferred to the carbon nitride nanosheets (CNNSs), which are then coupled with MIL-88B(Fe) to form the hybrid. From the results of the powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electronic microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis, it is found that the doping of CNNSs on the surface of MIL-88(Fe) could maintain the basic structure of MIL-88B(Fe), and the smaller dimension of CNNSs might influence the crystallization process of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) compared to bulk g-C3 N4 . Besides, the effects of the CNNSs incorporation on photocatalysis are also investigated. Through the photoluminescence spectra, electrochemical measurements, and photocatalytic experiments, the hybrid containing 6% CNNSs is certified to possess the highest catalytic activity to degrade methylene blue and reduce Cr(VI) under visible light. The improvement of the photocatalytic performance can be attributed to the matched energy level which favors the formation of the heterojunctions. Besides, it promotes the charge migration such that the contact between MOFs and CNNSs is more intimate, which can be inferred from the electronic microscopy images. Finally, a possible photocatalytic mechanism is put forward by the relative calculation and the employment of the scavengers to trap the active species.
A novel synergistic confinement strategy for controlled synthesis of high-entropy alloy electrocatalysts	We report a synergistic confinement strategy for the synthesis of high-entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEA-NPs). The carbon nitride substrate and polydopamine coating layer synergistically confine the growth of NPs and contribute to the formation of homogeneous HEA-NPs. The HEA-NPs exhibit superior electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. This work demonstrates the great potential of HEA-NPs for electrocatalysis.
Functionalized conjugated polymer with plasmonic Au nanoalloy for photocatalytic hydrogen generation under visible-NIR	Gold based multimetallic nanoalloys decorated on conjugated polymer nanofibers have been prepared using a greener approach without using any reducing agent. The as prepared nanohybrids exhibited superior catalytic activity for solar hydrogen production under visible light (lambda > 420 nm) irradiation and near infrared light irradiation. The UV Visible diffuse reflectance spectra displayed strong absorption in the visible region which significantly favours the photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the efficient charge separation suggested by electrochemical impedance measurement and photocurrent response curves for Au50Pt24Pd26/PPy nanohybrids which exhibited significant enhancement in H-2 generation rate compared to Au/PPy nanohybrids. The strong interface contact between Au nanoalloys and PPy nanofibers play an important role for the migration of electron during catalysis. The Mott-Schottky plot revealed that photo generated charge carrier concentration has been increased for Au50Pt24Pd26/PPy nanohybrids (7.93 x 10(11)cm(-3)) compare to pure PPy (1.43 x 10(11) cm(-3)). The present study provides a new prospect for using conducting polymer based hybrid as photocatalysts for efficient solar hydrogen production. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Facile synthesis of organic-inorganic layered nanojunctions of g-C3N4/(BiO)2CO3 as efficient visible light photocatalyst	Novel g-C3N4/(BiO)2CO3 organic-inorganic nanojunctioned photocatalysts were synthesized by in situ depositing (BiO)2CO3 nanoflakes onto the surface of g-C3N4 nanosheets through a one-pot efficient capture of atmospheric CO2 method at room temperature. The as-synthesized samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), N2 adsorption-desorption analysis and electron spin resonance (ESR). The photocatalytic activity of as-synthesized samples was evaluated by degrading Rhodamine B (RhB) and phenol in aqueous solution under visible-light irradiation. The g-C3N4/(BiO)2CO3 nanojunctions showed much higher visible-light photocatalytic activity than those of pure g-C3N4 and (BiO)2CO3 for the degradation of RhB and phenol. The enhanced photocatalytic activity can be mainly ascribed to the well-matched band structures, dye photosensitization and efficient crystal facets coupling interaction between g-C3N4 {002} and (BiO)2CO3 {002}. The ˙O2(-) radicals were identified as the main active species. Furthermore, the pure (BiO)2CO3 with highly exposed {002} crystal facets also exhibited excellent visible-light photoactivity for the degradation of RhB, which can be originated from the indirect dye photosensitization. The present work could provide a new strategy for the efficient utilization of atmospheric CO2 in green synthetic chemistry.
Highly efficient Fenton-like catalyst Fe-g-C3N4 porous nanosheets formation and catalytic mechanism	The redox ability and electron transmission of the catalyst affects the activity in Fenton process. Fe-g-C3N4 porous nanosheets were facilely synthesized with various Fe contents. The as-synthesized sample exhibited weakened redox ability and enhanced electron transmission than the g-C3N4. The Fe-g-C3N4 showed significant higher catalytic activity for degrading methylene blue (MB) than the g-C3N4. The electron transmission was enhanced for the bond formation between the pyridinic N in g-C3N4 and Fe atoms. The Fe atom was active site for Fenton reaction. Simultaneously, the chemical bond formation limited the Fe leaching to avoid second environmental pollution. More important, no clear effect of pH on catalytic activity of the sample was found. Total organic carbon (TOC) reduction reached as high as 83.7% with 60 mg/L of MB for 60 min. These results demonstrated that the as-formed catalyst showed significant potential for actual application in environmental treatment.
Transformation of g-C3N4 into onion like carbon on nickel nanoparticles for ultrafast hydrogenation	
Enhanced triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion by photonic crystals and Au plasma resonance for efficient photocatalysis	Strong upconversion luminescence is significant for effective photocatalytic technology. In this work, photonic crystals and Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) were introduced together to enhance triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) luminescence intensity. Photonic crystal films have been fabricated by demolding a polydimethylsiloxane film containing platinum(ii)-octaethylporphyrin & 9,10-diphenylanthracene and AuNPs from V-shape anodic aluminum oxide templates. The blue light intensity of the photonic crystal film with AuNPs has gained a 3.69-fold enhancement under green light excitation. After coupling the photonic crystal structure with AuNP plasma resonance, the green-to-blue TTA-UC intensity of the composite film has been enhanced 7.68 times compared with the planar upconversion film without AuNPs. The pseudo-first-order rate constant of the composite film system with g-C3N4@CdS has been increased 3.88 times compared with that of the planar upconversion film system without AuNPs under visible light. This work presents a new route to enhance the TTA-UC luminescence via a hybrid effect, which is useful for photocatalysis.
Lysine-50 is a likely site for anchoring the plasminogen N-terminal peptide to lysine-binding kringles	Interactions between the kringle 4 (K4) domain of human plasminogen (Pgn) and segments of the N-terminal Glu1-Lys77 peptide (NTP) have been investigated via 1H-NMR at 500 MHz. NTP peptide stretches devoid of Lys residues but carrying an internal Arg residue show negligible affinity toward K4 (equilibrium association constant Ka < 0.05 mM(-1)). In contrast, while most fragments containing an internal Lys residue exhibit affinities comparable to that shown by the blocked Lys derivative Nalpha-acetyl-L-lysine-methyl ester (Ka approximately 0.2 mM(-1), peptides encompassing Lys50O consistently show higher Ka values. Among the investigated linear peptides, Nalpha-acetyl-Ala-Phe-Tyr-His-Ser-Ser-Lys5O-Glu-Gln-NH2 (AcAFYHSK5OEQ-NH2) exhibits the strongest interaction with K4 (Ka approximately 1.4 mM(-1)), followed by AcYHSK50EQ-NH2 (Ka approximately 0.9 mM(-1)). Relative to the wild-type sequence, mutated hexapeptides exhibit lesser affinity for K4. When a Lys50 --> Ser mutation was introduced (==> AcYHSS50EQ-NH2), binding was abolished. The Ile27-lle56 construct (L-NTP) contains the Lys50 site within a loop constrained by two cystine bridges. The propensity of recombinant Pgn K1 (rK1) and K2 (rK2) modules, and of Pgn fragments encompassing the intact K4 and K5 domains, for binding L-NTP, was investigated. We find that L-NTP interacts with rK1, rK2, K4, and K5-all lysine-binding kringles-in a fashion that closely mimics what has been observed for the Glul-HSer57 N-terminal fragment of Pgn (CB-NTP). Thus, both the constellation of kringle lysine binding site (LBS) aromatic residues that are perturbed upon complexation of L-NTP and magnitudes of kringle-L-NTP binding affinities (rK1, Ka approximately 4.3 mM(-1); rK2, Ka approximately 3.7 mM(-1; K4, Ka approximately 6.4 mM(1); and K5, Ka approximately 2.1 mM(-1)) are essentially the same as for the corresponding kringle-CB-NTP pairs. Molecular modeling studies suggest that the Glu39-Lys50 stretch in NTP generates an area that complements, both topologically and electrostatically, the solvent-exposed kringle LBS surface.

Biomimetic synthesis of C3N4/TiO2/Ag nanosheet composites with high visible-light photocatalytic performance	In order to more efficiently utilize solar energy, semiconductor-based nanocomposites with high visible-light responses have attracted much interest in recent years. In this study, a C3N4/TiO2/Ag nanosheet with a high visible-light photocatalytic performance has been synthesized via a biomimetic strategy under mild conditions. Firstly, TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) about 10 nm in diameter are loaded on a C3N4 nanosheet by the arginine-enabled biomimetic mineralization. Then, Ag NPs about 5 nm in size nucleate and grow on the TiO2 surface using 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propionic acid as an anchor and a reducer to form the TiO2-Ag heterojunction. The resultant C3N4/TiO2/Ag nanosheet exhibits significantly higher photoelectric conversion efficiency and photodegradation activity than pure C3N4 and C3N4/TiO2 under visible-light irradiation. Moreover, the loading amount of Ag nanocrystals can be readily regulated by changing the AgNO3 concentration. Both TiO2 and Ag play critical roles for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of C3N4/TiO2/Ag nanosheets. The band match of TiO2 with C3N4 is in favour of the separation of photo-generated carriers in C3N4, and the surface plasmon resonance effect of Ag nanocrystals induces the electron excitation in TiO2 NPs under visible light. This study offers a facile approach for the cost-effective and environmentally benign synthesis of high-efficiency photocatalysts.
One-step synthesis of phosphorus-doped g-C3N4/Co3O4 quantum dots from vitamin B12 with enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity for metronidazole degradation	In this study, Co3O4 quantum dots decorated phosphorus-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets was synthesized though one-step thermal polymerization method using vitamin B12 (VB12) as precursor of cobalt and phosphorus mixed with melamine. The prepared photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), BET, transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), photoluminescence (PL) and electrochemical measurements. Appropriate amount of introduced VB12 can improve photocatalytic activities while excess caused inhibition. The sample with the weight ratio of VB12 in precursors at 1% exhibited the optimum photodegradation efficiency for metronidazole (MTZ), about 2 times as higher as the removal rate of pure g-C3N4. Several effects on the photocatalytic activity was also investigated and the results showed that enough dissolved oxygen and presence of Fe3+ was found to promote MTZ photodegradation, while NO3-, Ca2+ and HCO3- would inhibit it. Superoxide radical center dot O-2(-) was identified as the dominate active specie in photodegradation process and possible enhancement mechanism of introduced VB12 for photocatalytic activities was proposed. It was inferred that the synergistic effect of generated Co3O4 quantum dots and P-doped g-C3N4, including increasing the separation efficiency of photo-inducted electrons and holes, inhibiting the recombination process of them and decreasing the band gap energy, could be the reason for the better photocatalytic activity. At last, MTZ degradation pathway in the photosystem was determined.
Stable Lithium Deposition Enabled by an Acid-Treated g-C3N4 Interface Layer for a Lithium Metal Anode	
Robust three-dimensional g-C3N4@cellulose aerogel enhanced by cross-linked polyester fibers for simultaneous removal of hexavalent chromium and antibiotics	Current environmental concerns have encouraged researchers to search for a facile, environmentally-friendly and efficient method for sewage treatment. Cellulose aerogels (CAs) with high porosities, large specific surfaces and sustainability are promising candidates as catalytic carriers to solve many environment problems. However, pure CAs often lack mechanical strength and are prone to collapse under a small force, especially in water. Here, blended polyester fibers (B-PET) were used to support a CA containing nanosheet graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), which greatly enhanced the tensile strength of the pure CA. Moreover, the composited aerogel, gC3N4@CA/B-PET, showed high impact resistance in the water impact experiment and maintained its robust structure after 24 h of water shock. The g-C3N4@ CA/B-PET exhibited a favorable photocatalytic activity towards the removal of hexavalent chromium and antibiotics simultaneously, which could challenge freestanding g-C3N4. The as-prepared composite material could be reused easily and maintained its excellent photocatalytic performance in cycling tests. Finally, the possible pathway for the degradation of sulfaquinoxaline and the mechanism in this photocatalytic system were proposed, where the superoxide radicals (center dot O-2(-)) were the dominant active species, resulting in the oxidation of antibiotics. In addition, the photoelectrons could reduce the toxic hexavalent chromium to harmless trivalent chromium.
Photocatalytic H-2 evolution and CO2 reduction over phosphorus-doped g-C3N4 nanostructures: Electronic, Optical, and Surface properties	Attaining an extremely efficient photocatalyst has drawn a great deal of attention in the worldwide pursuit of using solar power as an abundant and cheap energy source. Layered compounds have demonstrated a wide range of physicochemical properties that support their potential practical applications. Because dimensionality plays a crucial role in determining fundamental properties of lamellar structure, when they go under exfoliation down to few-layer or monolayer nanosheets, their characteristics will differ from those of their stacked bulks. The photocatalytic properties of these few-layer or mono-layer materials can be improved through in-plane and interplane structural modification by doping with metal or non-metal elements. Among the various layered materials, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has emerged as one of the most promising photocatalysts due to its metalfree nature, abundance in raw material, thermal and physicochemical stability and suitable bandgap. Although its bulk structure shows a weak photocatalytic activity, its thermally or chemically exfoliated nanosheets demonstrate greatly improved activity. Further, the electronic structure of the nanostructures can be modified by elemental doping with triazine units to activate the pi-conjugated system in the photocatalytic reaction. In this review paper, we analyze the latest developments, particularly in the area of phosphorous-doped graphitic carbon nitride (P-doped g-C3N4) photocatalysts and their molecular and structural modifications for improving H-2 generation and CO2 conversion to solar fuels.
MoS2 Quantum Dots Modified Black Ti3+-TiO2/g-C3N4 Hollow Nanosphere Heterojunction toward Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production Enhancement	The MoS2 quantum dots (QDs) modified black Ti3+-TiO2/g-C3N4 hollow nanosphere heterojunction is synthesized via the continuous chemical template deposition and sculpture-reduction processes. The results of structural characterizations imply that the Ti3+-TiO2/g-C3N4/MoS2 QDs hollow nanosphere heterojunction is prepared successfully. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of the B-TiO2/g-C3N4/MoS2 QDs (approximate to 1524.37 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) exhibits an enhancement of approximate to 33 folds compared with the normal TiO2. Furthermore, the process of photocatalysis and the mechanism of photocatalytic HER enhancement are explored, which can be ascribed to the HER activity sites of MoS2 QDs, Ti3+/O-v ions in the Ti3+-TiO2, and hollow nanosphere heterojunction, which are proved by electrochemical measurements.
Hydrothermal fabrication of alpha-SnWO4/g-C3N4 heterostructure with enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity	The novel alpha-SnWO4/g-C3N4 composites have been successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. The crystalline structure, physicochemical property and morphology of the as-prepared samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, UV-vis and PL. Compared to the pristine alpha-SnWO4 and g-C3N4, the alpha-SnWO4/g-C3N4 heterostructure exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity toward the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) under visible light irradiation, which can be attributed to the effective electrons/holes transfer and separation, due to the heterojunction formed between alpha-SnWO4 and g-C3N4. Moreover, the alpha-SnWO4/g-C3N4 demonstrated good recyclability properties which were beneficial for its practical application. The photocatalytic mechanism of the alpha-SnWO4/g-C3N4 was also discussed.
Embedding Sodium Ions in Graphitic Carbon Nitride Vacancies for Visible Light Photocatalytic H-2 Evolution	In this work, through first-principles density functional theory calculations, Na ions embedded in the vacancies of the aromatic ring plane of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C-3 N-4) were predicted to bridge the transfer of photoinduced charge carriers and subsequently enhance its photocatalytic activity. Thereafter, Na-functionalized g-C3N4 (Na/CN) was synthesized via a one-step polymerization of melamine and NaBH4. The formation of coordinative Na-N bonds with the N atoms at the edge of aromatic rings resulted in a bridge that facilitated the transfer and separation of photogenerated carriers, changed the electronic band structure of g-C3N4, enhanced the separation degree of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), and increased the visible light absorption, thus realizing efficient photocatalytic hydrogen generation under visible light. The hydrogen evolution rate of 10 mg of photocatalyst 10Na/CN reached 17.4 mu mol/h under visible light irradiation with lambda > 420 nm, which was about 12.8 and 35.0 times higher than those of Nw/CN nanowires and Bulk/CN, respectively.
Research on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mechanism of g-C3N4 doped by Ag based on first-principles calculations	Developing non-platinum composite catalysts has become a hot research topic for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this study, Ag/g-C3N4 (the mass ratio of Ag and g-C3N4 = 3%) catalysts were prepared through a photoreduction method. The catalytic performance of g-C3N4 was greatly enhanced after Ag doping. The current density of Ag/g-C3N4 was -21 mu A/mm(2), which is 3 times that of pure g-C3N4. The mechanism of ORR activity enhancement is discussed based on first-principles calculation. Ag, as the active site, can reduce the reaction barrier and enhance ORR activity. Combining experimental and computational results forms the subject of this study.
Bovine alpha s0 casein; a phosphorylated homologue of alpha s1 casein	After consideration of its electrophoretic behaviour, amino acid composition and phosphate content, bovine alpha s0 casein has been shown to differ from alpha s1 casein only in respect of its phosphate content. The presence in alpha s0 casein of one phosphate residue more than occurs in alpha s1 casein was confirmed by comparative degradative studies performed on both proteins. From these it was concluded that alpha s0 casein may be considered as being alpha s1 casein which has been modified by phosphorylation of the seryl residue located at position 41.
AgCl Loaded Mesoporous Graphitic Carbon Nitride as Visible Light Photocatalyst	
Renewable Biomass-Derived Hierarchically Porous Carbonaceous Sponge (CS)/g-C3N4 Composites as Adsorption and Photocatalytic Materials	In this work, the preparation, characterization and removal capability of hierarchically porous carbonaceous sponges and their g-C3N4/CS composites were described. Possessing a hierarchically porous structure and extremely large surface areas, g-C3N4/CS composites are demonstrated to have advantages in adsorption and photocatalytic activities. The adsorption and photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared catalysts were evaluated by the degradation of RhB, MO, and phenol. The best results showed that 97% decomposition of RhB was obtained by using g-C3N4/CS-60 composites within 20 min at 25 degrees C under visible light irradiation. Furthermore, the g-C3N4/CS-60 composites showed remarkable regeneration stability, which maintains high photocatalytic activity after the samples are saturated. Additionally, the degradation mechanisms of RhB and the photocatalytic mechanism are explained in this paper.
Reptile lysozyme: the complete amino acid sequence of soft-shelled turtle lysozyme and its activity	Soft-shelled turtle egg-white lysozyme was purified and sequenced. Lysozyme was reduced and carboxymethylated to fragment it with trypsin, V8 protease and CNBr. The peptides yielded were purified by RP-HPLC and sequenced. Every trypsin peptide was overlapped by V8 protease peptides and CNBr fragment. The amino acid sequence was compared with other lysozymes. This lysozyme has an extra Gly residue at N-terminus, which was found in pheasant lysozyme. Further, this lysozyme has an insertion of a Gly residue between 47 and 48 residues when compared with chicken lysozyme, as found in human lysozyme, therefore it proved that this lysozyme has the largest number of amino acids (131 aa) in chicken type lysozymes. The amino acid substitutions were found at subsites E and F. Namely Phe34, Arg45, Thr47, and Arg114 were replaced by His, Tyr, Arg, and Tyr, respectively. The time course using N-acetylglucosamine pentamer as a substrate showed a reduction of the rate constant for glycosidic cleavage and increase of binding free energy for subsites E and F, which proved the contribution of amino acids mentioned above for substrate binding at subsites E and F.
Heterogeneous Fenton-like surface properties of oxygenated graphitic carbon nitride	The photo-Fenton activity of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been widely studied, nevertheless, its Fenton-like catalytic behavior in the dark has not yet been demonstrated. In the present work, it is shown that oxygenated g-C3N4 obtained at different temperatures (500-600 °C) can degrade indigo carmine with hydrogen peroxide in the dark by a reaction similar to a conventional Fenton's reaction. Based on an extensive characterization of g-C3N4, we conclude that Fenton-like activity is directly related to the oxygenated functional groups on g-C3N4 structure, mainly by -OH functional groups. Oxygenated functional groups (e.g., hydroquinone-like groups) can reduce the H2O2 and generate oxidizing hydroxyl radicals, just like in the Fenton reaction performed by metals. In addition to new information on g-C3N4 surface reactivity revealed by this study, the metal-free oxygenated g-C3N4 catalyst may be an alternative to traditional metal catalysts used in Fenton-like reactions for advanced oxidation.
Insights into the Relationship of the Heterojunction Structure and Excellent Activity: Photo-Oxidative Coupling of Benzylamine on CeO2-rod/g-C3N4 Hybrid under Mild Reaction Conditions	Oxidation of amines to imines under light irradiation has been widely studied in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. For the first time, we demonstrate a facile mixing calcination approach for the preparation of CeO2/g-C3N4-x as a heterojunction catalyst for the photo oxidative coupling of benzylamine under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe arc lamp at 308 K with the air balloon. It was found that the rate constant of CeR/CN-66% was 3 times as high as that of pure CeO2 or g-C3N4. All kinds of structural characterizations suggested the formation of heterojunction between the CeO2 and g-C3N4, serving as a tunnel for the transfer of photoinduced charge, which may contribute to the improvement of photoactivity. Moreover, the Ce3+ ions and oxygen vacancy significantly promoted the adsorption and activation of substrate or molecular O-2. Therefore, the efficient separation of the charges, the prolonged photoinduced electron lifetime, and the abundant defect structure (increased content of Ce3+ ions or the oxygen vacancy) were considered as the main factors for the higher photo-oxidation efficiency of the CeR/CN-66%. Another striking observation that was noticed was that the CeR/CN-66% was recycled up to five cycles under the same condition and was found to be highly efficient without any obvious decrease in the activity or selectivity due to the outstanding stability of the defect structure. Thus, highly efficient CeR/CN-x heterojunction catalyst was synthesized in this work by a simple approach for the photo-oxidation of benzylamine under mild reaction conditions, and this finding may provide wide applications in other photocatalysis areas.
A facile and rapid route for synthesis of g-C3N4 nanosheets with high adsorption capacity and photocatalytic activity	A graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheet and its nanocomposites have recently attracted increasing interest due to their massive potentials in applications ranging from fluorescence imaging to solar energy conversion. An economical mass-production method for the synthesis of g-C3N4 nanosheets is urgently needed for the application of these intriguing nanomaterials. Here we develop a facile and rapid route to synthesize g-C3N4 nanosheets by using chemical exfoliation followed by extraction and thermal treatment. The feature of this approach lies in its rapid speed with exfoliation time of only about one minute and facile operation free of long-time ultrasonication or stirring, filtration and repeated washing processes to remove the residual acid. Moreover, the method is high-yield and easily upscalable. Meanwhile, the exfoliated g-C3N4 nanosheets exhibit high adsorption capability and photocatalytic activity due to the synergistic effects of large surface area, decreased recombination probability of photoinduced electron-hole pairs and enlarged band gap. This simple and rapid route enables the possibility of large-scale synthesis of g-C3N4 nanosheets with high yield, thus promoting their application in environmental purification and solar energy conversion.
Designing of Carbon Nitride Supported ZnCo 2 O 4 Hybrid Electrode for High-Performance Energy Storage Applications	This study reports a unique graphitic-C3N4 supported ZnCo2O4 composite, synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method to enhance the electrochemical performance of the electrode. The g-C3N4@ZnCo2O4 hybrid composite based electrode exhibits a significant increase in specific surface area and maximum specific capacity of 157 mAhg-1 at 4 Ag-1. Moreover, g-C3N4@ZnCo2O4 electrode maintained significant capacity retention of 90% up to 2500 cycles. Utilizing this composite in the development of the symmetric device, g-C3N4@ZnCo2O4//g-C3N4@ZnCo2O4 displays a specific capacity of 121 mAhg-1. The device exhibits an energy density of 39 Whkg-1 with an equivalent power density of 1478 Wkg-1. A good cycling stability performance with an energy efficiency of 75% and capacity retention of 71% was observed up to 10,000 cycles. The superior performance of g-C3N4@ZnCo2O4 is attributed to the support of the g-C3N4 which increases the surface area, electroactive sites and provides chemical stability for electrochemical performance. The outstanding performance of this exclusive device symbolizes remarkable progress in the direction of high-performance energy storage applications.
Efficient synthesis of polymeric g-C3N4 layered materials as novel efficient visible light driven photocatalysts	In order to develop efficient visible light driven photocatalysts for environmental applications, novel polymeric g-C3N4 layered materials with high surface areas are synthesized efficiently from an oxygen-containing precursor by directly treating urea in air between 450 and 600 degrees C, without the assistance of a template for the first time. The as-prepared g-C3N4 materials with strong visible light absorption have a band gap around 2.7 eV. The crystallinity and specific surface areas of g-C3N4 increases simultaneously when the heating temperatures increases. The g-C3N4 materials are demonstrated to exhibit much higher visible light photocatalytic activity than that of C-doped TiO2 and g-C3N4 prepared from dicyanamide for the degradation of aqueous RhB. The large surface areas, layered structure and band structure in all contributed to the efficient visible light photocatalytic activity. The efficient synthesis method for g-C3N4 combined with efficient photocatalytic activity is of significant interest for environmental pollutants degradation and solar energy conversion in large scale applications.
Synthesized Z-scheme photocatalyst ZnO/g-C3N4for enhanced photocatalytic reduction of CO2	ZnO/g-C3N4was prepared by carrying out a simple one-step calcination process. The ZnO/g-C3N4composite was characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), transient photocurrent responses and photo-luminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Compared with pure g-C3N4, the composite showed increased photocurrent under UV irradiation, and overall significantly improved photocatalytic performance. Photocatalytic experiments showed specifically the composite made of a ZnO-to-g-C3N4mass ratio of 3 : 1 displaying the best catalytic performance. The yields of CO and CH(4)under UV irradiation were, respectively, 13.4 times and 49.7 times that of g-C3N4. In addition, a direct Z-scheme electron transfer mechanism was proposed to possibly play a large role in reducing charge recombination and to effectively improve photocatalytic CO(2)reduction.
Onion-like carbon modified porous graphitic carbon nitride with excellent photocatalytic activities under visible light	A series of onion-like carbon modified porous g-C3N4 (OLC/pg-C3N4) composites have been fabricated by a simple ultrasonic adsorption approach. The resultant OLC/pg-C3N4 composites exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity and stability towards the degradation of the dyes and phenol in aqueous solution under visible-light irradiation. The composite with 2.0 wt% OLC content shows the optimal photo catalytic activity for degrading rhodamine B (RhB), its rate constant is about three times that of pure pg-C3N4. The improved photocatalytic activity is mainly attributed to the synergetic effect of pg-C3N4 and OLC, including larger surface area, stronger visible light adsorption and efficient separation of photo generated electrons and holes. Moreover, a possible mechanism of photocatalytic reaction over OLC/pg-C3N4 composite is proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.
Preparation of nitrides and carbides from g-C3N4	By a facile solid-state reaction process using graphite-like phase Of C3N4 (g-C3N4) as a precursor with another one being corresponding elemental powders, we synthesized four technologically important nitrides and two carbides including cubic VN, CrN, hexagonal GaN, BN, WC and MoC at moderate temperatures. The products were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). The XRD results show that g-C3N4 is a highly efficient nitridizing and carbonizing reagent and the elemental powders are completely converted into the corresponding nitrides and carbides at lower temperatures than reported in the conventional methods. This novel route may provide new insights into the synthesis of other nitrides and carbides. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Fe-Doped g-C3N4: High-Performance Photocatalysts in Rhodamine B Decomposition	Herein, Fe-doped C3N4 high-performance photocatalysts, synthesized by a facile and cost effective heat stirring method, were investigated systematically using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurement, X-ray photoelectron (XPS), UV-Vis diffusion reflectance (DRS) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The results showed that Fe ions incorporated into a g-C3N4 nanosheet in both +3 and +2 oxidation states and in interstitial configuration. Absorption edge shifted slightly toward the red light along with an increase of absorbance in the wavelength range of 430-570 nm. Specific surface area increased with the incorporation of Fe into g-C3N4 lattice, reaching the highest value at the sample doped with 7 mol% Fe (FeCN7). A sharp decrease in PL intensity with increasing Fe content is an indirect evidence showing that electron-hole pair recombination rate decreased. Interestingly, Fe-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets present a superior photocatalytic activity compared to pure g-C3N4 in decomposing RhB solution. FeCN7 sample exhibits the highest photocatalytic efficiency, decomposing almost completely RhB 10 ppm solution after 30 min of xenon lamp illumination with a reaction rate approximately ten times greater than that of pure g-C3N4 nanosheet. This is in an agreement with the BET measurement and photoluminescence result which shows that FeCN7 possesses the largest specific surface area and low electron-hole recombination rate. The mechanism of photocatalytic enhancement is mainly explained through the charge transfer processes related to Fe2+/Fe3+ impurity in g-C3N4 crystal lattice.
Isolation and characterization of fibronectin from baboon plasma	Fibronectin has been purified from baboon plasma by affinity chromatography on immobilized gelatin. Baboon fibronectin has subunit sizes, CNBr and thermolysin peptide patterns and an amino acid composition similar to human fibronectin. In Ouchterlony plates, baboon plasma fibronectin gives an immunological reaction of identity with human fibronectin, and a partial reaction with hamster fibronectin, using a goat antibody to human fibronectin. By radial immunodiffusion and rocket immunoelectrophoresis, using the same antibody, baboon fibronectin gives a dose response pattern similar to human fibronectin. Plasma concentrations of fibronectin in baboons are similar to those in humans. Fibronectin is thus another interesting protein that is closely related to its human counterpart and can be studied in subhuman primates using available antibodies to the human protein.
Enhanced efficacy of defect passivation and charge extraction for efficient perovskite photovoltaics with a small open circuit voltage loss	Suppressed charge recombination and facilitated charge collection are critical for achieving perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with improved efficiency and stability. Herein, a multifunctional 2D polymeric semiconductor is incorporated into perovskite ink to assist the crystal growth of perovskite films with large grains and fewer defects. Anchoring heterogeneous polymeric molecules on perovskite not only enhances the efficacy of defect passivation at the grain boundaries and/or surface but also facilitates the charge extraction and collection, as evidenced by thermal admittance spectroscopy and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Accordingly, the PSCs incorporated with a polymeric semiconductor achieve power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 21.1% (aperture 0.16 cm(2)) and 19.5% (aperture 1.0 cm(2)), featuring an illustrious open-circuit voltage of 1.16 V (corresponding to a small voltage loss of 0.39 V) and an improved device operational stability (approximate to 90% initial efficiency retained after constant one sun illumination for 500 h). This work highlights the effectiveness of using multifunctional passivation agents capable of providing surprisingly robust efficacy in defect passivation of perovskite, which are also advantageous to crystal growth modulation and carrier dynamic management for efficient and stable PSCs.
Amino acid sequence of a novel calmodulin from Paramecium tetraurelia that contains dimethyllysine in the first domain	A class of Paramecium behavioral mutants called pantophobiacs have a deficiency in calcium-dependent potassium efflux, and this deficiency can be corrected by the microinjection of wild-type Paramecium calmodulin (Hinrichsen, R. D., Burgess-Cassler, A., Soltvelt, B. C., Hennessey, T., and Kung, C. (1986) Science 232, 503-506). As a starting point in investigations of which features allow wild-type Paramecium calmodulin to fully restore this behavior while other calmodulins are inactive or poorly effective, we elucidated the amino acid sequence of the wild-type calmodulin. We utilized an approach that combined Edman chemistry with mass spectrometry. This approach resulted in the identification of a new post-translational modification in calmodulin: N epsilon,N epsilon-dimethyllysine at residue 13. This particular modification has not been described for calmodulins studied previously. The only other first-domain modification that has been described for any calmodulin is acetylation of the amino terminus (Watterson, D. M., Sharief, F., and Vanaman, T. C. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 962-975). These results along with analyses of pantophobiac calmodulin and calmodulin binding proteins will provide insight into calmodulin's role in a well-defined behavioral mutant.

Ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence immunosensor for the detection of amyloid-beta proteins based on resonance energy transfer between g-C3N4 and Pd NPs coated NH2-MIL-53	An electrochemiluminescence (ECL) analytical platform was proposed for ultrasensitive detection of amyloid-beta proteins (A beta) based on the ECL resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET). In this work, gold nanoparticles-functionalized graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (g-C3N4@Au NPs) and palladium nanoparticles-coated Metal organic framework (Pd NPs@NH2-MIL-53) were synthesized, which were as ECL donor and ECL acceptor respectively. A strong cathode ECL emission was obtained from the g-C3N4@Au NPs when used K2S2O8 as its co-reactant. Here, Au NPs not only was used as an accelerator to enhance and stabilize the ECL signal, but also a connector for attaching A beta antibody. In addition, NH2-MIL-53(Al) was selected as a label material for supporting Pd NPs to synergistically increase the intensity and range of UV-visible absorption. The ECL signal of g-C3N4@Au NPs was intensely decreased when the ECL acceptor probe Pd NPs@NH2-MIL-53 was incubated onto the modified GCE by way of the specific recognition. Under the optimal condition, a wide detection range from 10 fg/mL to 50 ng/mL and a low detection limit of 3.4 fg/mL (S/N = 3) were obtained. In consideration of favorable specificity, stability and reproducibility, the proposed method was successfully applied for A beta detection in actual human serum samples and could be a potential analytical tool for sensitive molecular trace detection in clinical analysis.
Porous and low-defected graphitic carbon nitride nanotubes for efficient hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation	Porous and low-defect graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanotubes were fabricated through heating precursors synthesized by recrystallization from H2SO4/methanol. The textural and chemical structures of the as-prepared samples were well studied. Recrystallization and subsequent heating result in g-C3N4 nanotubes with developed porosity and high specific surface area. Unexpectedly, the nanotubes exhibit much ordered tri-s-triazine conjugated network and fewer defects. Compared to bulk g-C3N4 prepared by direct heating melamine, the nanotubes demonstrate enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation. Besides the improved textural and chemical structures, the optimized optical and electronic properties are contributed to the enhanced photocatalytic performance.
Mitochondrial adenylate kinase (AK2) from bovine heart. Homology with the cytosolic isoenzyme in the catalytic region	The adenylate kinase isoenzyme located in the intermembrane space of mitochondria, AK2, is a monomeric protein of Mr 30000 which catalyzes the reaction ATP + AMP + AMP in equilibrium 2 ADP. The protein was reduced and S-carboxymethylated with iodo[14C2]acetate. Using a Laursen sequenator, the N-terminal sequence of S-carboxymethylated AK2 was determined as Ala-Pro-Asn-; in some batches of the isolated protein the N-terminal dipeptide portion was missing. The C-terminus of AK2 was found to be Met. Cleavage with CNBr yielded eight fragments which could be isolated in one step using high-performance size-exclusion chromatography. They ranged in size over 4-88 amino acid residues, the total being approximately 270 residues. All CNBr fragments were overlapped with Met-containing tryptic peptides of AK2. The N-terminal 111 residues of AK2 were sequenced. Except for an N-terminal extension of nine residues, this segment of AK2 could be aligned with the sequence 1-104 of cytosolic AK1. Allowing for two deletions in AK2, 43 of the 102 aligned residues are identical. Since this section contains the catalytic residues such as His-36 and Asp-93, we conclude that AK1 can serve as a three-dimensional model of AK2 in mechanistic and drug-designing studies. preliminary sequence results on AK2 beyond position 104 show that AK2 here contains a wing of approximately 50 residues which has no counterpart in AK1. The chain folds of the adenylate kinase isoenzymes are similar again from a position corresponding to residue 115 of AK1 onwards. The additional structural motifs of AK2 are probably related to the location of this isoenzyme in the mitochondrion.
Plasma deposition and properties of silicon carbonitride films	A variety of advanced analytical techniques were used to characterize silicon carbonitride films grown from new volatile nitrogen-rich silyl derivatives of asymmetrical dimethylhydrazine: (CH3)(2)HSiNHN(CH3)(2) (DMDMSH) and Me2Si(NHNMe2)(2) (bisDMHDMS). The results demonstrate that the films contain only Si-C, Si-N, and C(sp(3))-N bonds, in relative amounts that depend on the molecular structure of the precursor and deposition conditions. The Si-C/[Si-N + C(sp(3))-N] ratio is considerably larger in the films grown from DMDMSH. The data obtained by a variety of spectroscopic techniques provide solid evidence that some of the films contain C(sp(3))-N bonds, characteristic of superhard materials, and that the films have a complex, framework structure, rather than being a mixture of Si3N4, SiC, and C3N4. The structure of the films depends on the N : Si ratio in the precursor: at N : Si = 2, the films are amorphous and contain nanocrystalline inclusions with a tetragonal structure; at N : Si = 4, the films are purely amorphous. The ability to control the chemical composition and structure of deposits allowed us to produce films with various physicochemical and electrical properties.
Solvothermal synthesis of various C3N4 films on FTO substrates and their photocatalytic and sensing applications	This paper reports solvothermal syntheses of pristine and KOH-NaCl-modified melon and melon-rGO composite films without post annealing and their applications in photocatalysis and Cu2+ sensing. Melon seed-layer coating enhanced film adhesion to fluorine-doped tin oxide substrates. X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy were used to verify melon film structures. Assorted complex agents were studied to tailor film morphologies. (001)-Oriented nanorods were observed in KOH-NaCl-modified melon films. Constituent elements were determined based on their binding energies using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Ultraviolet-visible and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy were employed to confirm band gaps and valence band positions, respectively, of melon films. Associated energy-band diagrams were then constructed. The melon-rGO composite films exhibited superior photodegradation of methylene blue (degradation rate constant [k] congruent to 6.4 x 10(-3)/min) and rhodamine B (k congruent to 2.5 x 10(-3)/min) under visible-light irradiation. The performance was confirmed by nanorod structures, low photoluminescence emission, and high electrochemical surface areas. Furthermore, a reliable photoelectrochemical current density (similar to 0.5 mA/cm(2)) at a 0.6-V bias was obtained for KOH-NaCl-modified melon and melon-rGO composite films. The KOH-NaCl-modified melon films demonstrated excellent selectivity between Cu2+ and Cr6+, indicating promising applications in Cu2+ sensing.
Interface self-assembly preparation of multi-element doped carbon nanobowls with high electrocatalysis activity for oxygen reduction reaction	Developing an efficient, stable and low cost oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst is desirable for fuel cells and metal-air batteries. Here, we have successfully prepared multi-element doped carbon nanobowls by simply mixing the porous carbon nanobowls and sulfur doped graphitic carbon nitride quantum dots in FeCl3 solution and subsequent high temperature treatment processes. Compared with the commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst, the multi-element doped carbon nanobowls display a comparable half-wave potential of 0.82 V, much larger limiting diffusion current density (0.4-0.8 V), better methanol-tolerance and higher long-term stability for the oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline media. The robust three-dimensional porous structure of carbon nanobowls and multiple active centers derived from Fe, N, S and O co-doping are responsible for the excellent performance. This work suggests that such multi-element doped carbon nanobowls can be a promising alternative for Pt-based catalysts in fuel cells.
2D Heterostructure Membranes with Sunlight-Driven Self-Cleaning Ability for Highly Efficient Oil-Water Separation	Introducing solar energy into membrane filtration to decrease energy and chemicals consumption represents a promising direction in membrane fields. In this study, a kind of 0D/2D heterojunction is fabricated by depositing biomineralized titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles with delaminated graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets, and subsequently a kind of 2D heterostructure membrane is fabricated via intercalating g-C3N4@TiO2 heterojunctions into adjacent graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets by a vacuum-assisted self-assembly process. Due to the enlarged interlayer spacing of GO nanosheets, the initial permeation flux of GO/g-C3N4@TiO2 membrane reaches to 4536 Lm(-2) h(-1) bar(-1), which is more than 40-fold of GO membranes (101 Lm(-2) h(-1) bar(-1)) when utilized for oil/water separation. To solve the sharp permeation flux decline, arising from the adsorption of oil droplets, the a sunlight-driven self-cleaning process is followed, maintaining a flux recovery ratio of more than 95% after ten cycles of filtration experiment. The high permeation flux and excellent sunlight-driven flux recovery of these heterostructure membranes manifest their attractive potential application in water purification.
Enhanced Cycling Performance for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries by a Laminated 2D g-C3N4/Graphene Cathode Interlayer	Decay in electrochemical performance resulting from the "shuttle effect" of dissolved lithium polysulfides is one of the biggest obstacles for the realization of practical applications of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. To meet this challenge, a 2D g-C3N4/graphene sheet composite (g-C3N4/GS) was fabricated as an interlayer for a sulfur/carbon (S/KB) cathode. It forms a laminated structure of channels to trap polysulfides by physical and chemical interactions. The thin g-C3N4/GS interlayer significantly suppresses diffusion of the dissolved polysulfide species (Li2Sx; 2<x <= 8) from the cathode to the anode, as proven by using an H-type glass cell divided by a g-C3N4/GS-coated separator. The S/KB cathode with the g-C3N4/GS interlayer (S/KB@C3N4/GS) delivers a discharge capacity of 1191.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C after 100 cycles, an increase of more than 90 % compared with an S/KB cathode alone (625.8 mAh g(-1)). The S/KB@C3N4/GS cathode shows good cycling life, delivering a discharge capacity as high as 612.4 mAh g(-1) for 1 C after 1000 cycles. According to XPS results, the anchoring of the g-C3N4/GS interlayer to Li2Sx can be attributed to a coefficient chemical binding effect of g-C3N4 and graphene on long-chain polysulfides. Generally, the improvement in electrochemical performance originates from a coefficient of the enhanced Li+ diffusion coefficient, increased charge transfer, and the weakening of the shuttle effect of the dissolved Li2Sx as a result of the g-C3N4/GS interlayer.
Corrosion properties of organic polymer coating reinforced two-dimensional nitride nanostructures: a comprehensive review	Due to the harmful effects of corrosion in various industries, researchers aim to create more effective coatings with recent nanotechnology advances to prevent the corrosion of materials. For this purpose, one of the most efficient ways is to use new classes of nanocomposite coatings, obtained by the addition of inorganic nanofillers to the polymer matrix, which superior performance over conventional composite coatings. As a filler, Two-dimensional materials can dramatically change the reduction with economic loss due to their outstanding chemical, mechanical, and thermal properties. To date, the essential nanomaterials used as reinforcements in polymer matrices are graphene and clay. Graphene has a cathodic behavior towards all metals and leads to galvanic corrosion over time. Clay contains ions that increase the ionic content and, consequently, the ionic conductivity of the polymer composites. Ionic and electron conductivity result in the deterioration of the corrosion properties. Today, inorganic nanomaterials such as nitride nanoparticles such as h-BN, h-BCN, and g-C3N4 have significant potential to increase the barrier performance of polymer coatings. These additives have a high-energy barrier against the penetration of corrosive ions, which leads to excellent corrosion protection properties. On the other hand, the BN nanoparticles prevent the galvanic corrosion of metal substrates due to their insulating properties. In this review, the effects of adding the aforementioned nitride nanomaterials to polymer coatings are discussed in terms of the resultant corrosion protection performance, and a comprehensive study on the corrosion resistance of these coatings is conducted.
Cu single-atoms embedded in porous carbon nitride for selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates	Cu single atoms embedded in the C3N4 (Cu-SAs/C3N4) matrix exhibited high activity with 95% oxygenate selectivity for the direct conversion of methane at ambient temperature. The presence of abundant anchoring sites in C3N4 led to highly dispersed Cu-N4 moieties, which were suggested to be the underlying active sites for methane conversion.
Rational design 2D/2D BiOBr/CDs/g-C3N4 Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst with carbon dots as solid-state electron mediators for enhanced visible and NIR photocatalytic activity: Kinetics, intermediates, and mechanism insight	Rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers and narrow visible light absorption range are two main defects in graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)-based photocatalysts. To address these problems, construction of Z-scheme 2D/2D BiOBr/CDs/g-C3N4 heterojunction photocatalysts with carbon dots as solid-state electron mediators has been investigated. The resultant BiOBr/CDs/g-C3N4 hybrids exhibits remarkable interfacial charge transfer abilities and a broadened solar light absorption range owing to the short charge transport distance and the up-converted photoluminescence character of CDs. Simultaneously, the enhanced specific surface area and nanosheet structure impart more active sites to BiOBr/CDs/g-C3N4 composites. As a result, BiOBr/CDs/g-C3N4 composites reveal significant enhancement in the activity of photodegradation of ciprofloxacin (CIP) and tetracycline (TC) under visible and near infrared (NIR) light irradiation. Moreover, the photodegradation efficiency of BiOBr/CDs/g-C3N4 hybrids was significantly enhanced over that of pristine BiOBr nanosheets and g-C3N4 ultrathin nanosheets. The photocatalytic mechanism is expounded according to free radical capture experiments and electron spin resonance spin-trapping tests and the photodegradation intermediates of CIP were detected by liquid chromatography-mass/mass spectrometry. Moreover, BiOBr/CDs/g-C3N4 composites show excellent photostability and reusability after four runs for CIP degradation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
Biomimetic fabrication of g-C3N4/TiO2 nanosheets with enhanced photocatalytic activity toward organic pollutant degradation	A facile and efficient approach was first developed to prepare g-C3N4/TiO2 nanocomposites by combining the arginine-enabled biomimetic mineralization of TiO2 with the thermal oxidation etching of bulk g-C3N4. The resultant g-C3N4/TiO2 nanocomposites exhibit a well-defined morphology, in which TiO2 nanoparticles about 5.5 nm in diameter are uniformly distributed on the g-C3N4 nanosheet. They exhibit higher degradation efficiency for Rhodamine B (RhB) than TiO2, g-C3N4 and their mixture under visible light and simulated-sunlight irradiation. In all the as-prepared samples, the g-C3N4/TiO2 nanosheet with 25.9 wt% of g-C3N4 exhibits the highest photocatalytic efficiency, which can degrade almost all RhB under simulated-sunlight irradiation within 50 min. The synergistic effect between TiO2 and g-C3N4 plays an important role for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4/TiO2 nanosheets. This kind of sheet-like nanocomposites may find the potential application for the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Acid-induced molecule self-assembly synthesis of Z-scheme WO3/g-C3N4 heterojunctions for robust photocatalysis against phenolic pollutants	Searching for effective strategies of boosting charge carrier separation and improving photooxidation ability are highly desirable to design graphitic carbon nitride-based photocatalysts for efficient organic pollutant degradation. Here we demonstrate an in situ acid-induced self-assembly of melamine and sodium tungstate method combined with hydrothermal treatment, by forming WO3/melamine-cyanuric acid supramolecular complex, to fabricate porous sheet-like WO3/g-C3N4 heterojunctions with oxygen doping; meanwhile, the morphology of WO3/g-C3N4 nanosheets can be further regulated by selecting different short-chain carboxylic acids. The heterojunctions exhibit enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity than bulk g-C3N4 and supramolecule-based g-C3N4 in degradation of phenolic pollutants, acetaminophen and methylparaben. The tests including active species trapping, photoelectrochemistry and photoluminescence firmly evidence that the extraordinary Z-scheme charge transfer manner plays dominated role to this excellent activity, which can accelerate charge carrier separation and retain powerful redox ability of electrons on conduction band of g-C3N4 and holes on valence band of WO3 simultaneously; additionally, porous sheet-like nanostructures and oxygen doping also positively influence the activity via improving light harvesting, providing plentiful active sites, shortening charge carrier migration distance and further facilitating charge carrier separation. LC-MS analysis and TOC monitoring find the target pollutants are completely degraded under oxidation of holes, superoxide and hydroxyl radicals.
Construction of Schottky-type Ag-loaded fiber-like carbon nitride photocatalysts for tetracycline elimination and hydrogen evolution	In this study, a series of Schottky-type Ag-loaded fiber-like carbon nitride photocatalysts (Ag/CNF) were prepared via a combination of the solvothermal method and sodium borohydride reduction. Transmission electron microscopy images revealed that Ag particles with diameters of 10-20 nm were evenly deposited on the CNF. The Ag/CNF Schottky-type composites exhibited strong photocatalytic activity for tetracycline (TC) degradation upon irradiation with visible light. The rate constant for TC degradation was enhanced approximately 23.56 and 2.97 times in the presence of the 1.2%-Ag/CNF composite as compared with bulk g-C3N4 and CNF, respectively. In addition, the Ag-CNF Schottky-type composites promoted hydrogen evolution. Free radical trap experiments and electron spin resonance results revealed that holes (h(+)) and superoxide radicals (center dot O-2(-)) were the major active species during the photocatalytic degradation. The improved photocatalytic performance was attributable to the surface plasmon resonance of Ag and the effective separation of the photogenerated charges due to the construction of Schottky junctions between Ag and the semiconductors. This work might provide a basis for the construction of carbon nitride-based Schottky-type heterojunctions for hydrogen evolution and elimination of TC from the environment.
Preparation of Nested g-C3N4 Fiber Surrounding Graphene Oxide and Its Photocatalytic Degradation of Rhodamine B	g-C3N4 and graphene oxide (GO) are simultaneously introduced into electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers to form a nested structure. By Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), g-C3N4 has been perfectly introduced into the PAN@GO nanofiber membrane and affects the porosity of the fiber itself. Comparison of nested electrospinning PAN/PAN@GO and different proportions of PAN@g-C3N4/PAN@GO nanofibers has a different effect on reducing the concentration and absorption of rhodamine B (RhB) dye in the visible region. Combined with the advantages of g-C3N4 and GO and the performance of fibers in the photocatalytic process, the optimal nested PAN@g-C3N4/PAN@GO nanofibers were selected. These results indicate that the nested PAN@g-C3N4/PAN@GO nanofibers with high photocatalytic activity have great potential in the treatment of printing and dyeing wastewater.
Constructing effective photocatalytic purification system with P-introduced g-C3N4 for elimination of UO22+	
Three-dimensional flower-like phosphorus-doped g-C3N4 with a high surface area for visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution	Flower-like P-doped graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with a high surface area and porosity has been prepared via a facile, template-free, cost-effective and thermal copolymerization route, using phosphoric acid as the phosphorus source and a cyanuric acid-melamine complex as the supramolecular precursor. It could be found that phosphoric acid could stabilize the three-dimensional character of the as-prepared P-doped g-C3N4 and the g-C3N4 micro-flower consisted of ultrathin nanosheets which possessed abundant mesopores. The unique structure, combined with phosphorus heteroatom doping, promoted the utilization of visible light and improved the separation and mobility of photogenerated charges. The obtained P-doped g-C3N4 exhibited prominent photocatalytic performance in the water splitting for the hydrogen evolution reaction under visible light irradiation. The hydrogen evolution rate reached 256.4 mol h(-1), almost 24 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4. Meanwhile, a possible mechanism for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was proposed according to the results.
Enhancing Visible-Light Hydrogen Evolution Performance of Crystalline Carbon Nitride by Defect Engineering	Crystalline carbon nitride (CCN)-based semiconductors have recently attracted widespread attention in solar energy conversion. However, further modifying the photocatalytic ability of CCN always results in a trade-off between high crystallinity and good photocatalytic performance. Herein, a facile defect engineering strategy was demonstrated to modify the CCN photocatalysts. Results confirmed that the obtained D-CCN maintained the high crystallinity; additionally, the hydrogen production rate of D-CCN was approximately 8 times higher than that of CCN. Particularly, it could produce H2 even if the incident light wavelength extended to 610 nm. The significantly improved photocatalytic activity could be ascribed to the introduction of defects into the CCN polymer network to form the midgap states, which significantly broadened the visible-light absorption range and accelerated the charge separation for photoredox catalysis.
Structure and stability of carbon nitride under high pressure and high temperature up to 125 GPa and 3000 K	The crystal structure of carbon nitride under high pressure and temperature was investigated up to megabar pressures using graphitic C3N4 as a starting material. It transformed to an orthorhombic phase above 30 GPa and 1600 K, which has a similar unit cell parameters (a = 7.6251(19), b = 4.4904(8), and c = 4.0424(8) A at 1 atm) to those of reported hydrogen-bearing carbon nitride phases such as C2N2(NH) and C2N2(CH2). Although the C:N ratio of this orthorhombic phase was carefully determined to be 3:4, FT-IR analysis showed a strong possibility of hydrogen contamination both in the starting and recovered samples. These results suggest that in the studied wide pressure and temperature range, hydrogen-bearing carbon nitride favors the orthorhombic structure with a fundamental composition of C2N2X where NH, CH2, and even potentially vacancies can be flexibly accommodated in the X site.

3D-Printed Grids with Polymeric Photocatalytic System as Flexible Air Filter	
Panulirus interruptus hemocyanin. The amino acid sequence of subunit b and anomalous behaviour of subunits a and b on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS	The primary structure of subunit b of Panulirus interruptus hemocyanin has been derived from two digests (trypsin and CNBr) and, in some cases, with aid from the similarity with the sequence of subunit a. Differences between the amidation states of Asx and Glx residues in subunit b relative to a were investigated more thoroughly. When compared to the sequence of subunit a, 18 differences (2.7%) were found and certain heterogeneities, indicating the presence of a minor subunit b', were observed. Several differences in properties between subunits a and b, including their anomalous behaviour on SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, could be explained by amino acid replacements.
Construction of Ag/g-C3N4 photocatalysts with visible-light photocatalytic activity for sulfamethoxazole degradation	Ag/g-C3N4 was successfully synthesized by a photo-reduction method. By using PVP as a protecting agent, Ag nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on (c) sheets and the average diameter (ca. 20 nm) of Ag nanoparticles were well controlled when increasing Ag content from 1 wt% to 10 wt%. The visible-light-induced photocatalytic activity of Ag/g-C3N4 was investigated by the degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX). The results exhibited that Ag/g-C3N4 displayed excellent visible-light photocatalytic performance. Compared with g-C3N4, the removal efficiency of SMX by 5 wt% Ag/g-C3N4 was increased by 32.1% and the TOC removal was increased by 11.5% due to the SPR effect of Ag nanoparticles. Compared with Ag/g-C3N4 synthesized without PVP, the removal efficiency of SMX by the 5 wt% Ag/g-C(3)N(4 )was increased by 10.2%. Photogenerated holes and center dot O-2(-) radicals were identified as the main active species and three intermediates were identified in SMX degradation by 5 wt% Ag/g-C3N4, which were the same as that by g-C3N4, but the changing trend of produced intermediates was different. The produced intermediates of m/z 99 and m/z 270 can be further degraded by 5 wt% Ag/g-C3N4, but not by g-C3N4. The 5 wt% Ag/g-C3N4 also exhibited superior photocatalytic performance on the photodegradation of SMX in real waters, such as surface water and WWTP secondary effluent. This work may provide an appealing strategy on green remediation of contaminated water environment.
MgO/g-C3N4 nanocomposites as efficient water splitting photocatalysts under visible light irradiation	A series of MgO/g-C3N4 nanocomposites was prepared by calcination of the mixture of magnesium nitrate hexahydrate and g-C3N4 , and applied as photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution from water splitting. The results demonstrate that the MgO/g-C3N4 nanocomposites can effectively harvest sunlight to produce hydrogen from water with higher photocatalytic efficiency than the bare g-C3N4 . A high hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 30.1 mu mol h (-1) was achieved under visible light for the MgO/g-C3N4 composite loaded with 1 wt% MgO, which is much higher than that of the bare g-C3N4 (5.76 mu mol h (-1)). The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the MgO/g-C3N4 composite could be attributed to the formation of heterojunction between g-C3N4 and MgO that promotes the photo-induced charge carriers' transmission and separation.

A mesoporous tungsten carbide nanostructure as a promising cathode catalyst decreases overpotential in Li-O-2 batteries	Lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2) batteries as promising energy storage devices possess high gravimetric energy density and low emission. However, poor reversibility of electrochemical reactions at the cathode significantly affects the electrochemical properties of nonaqueous Li-O-2 batteries, and low charge-discharge efficiency also results in short cycle-life. In this work, functional air cathodes containing mesoporous tungsten carbide nanoparticles for improving the reversibility of positive reactions in Li-O-2 cells are designed. Mesoporous tungsten carbides are synthesized with mesoporous carbon nitride as the reactive template and carbon source. And mesoporous tungsten carbides in cathode materials display better electrochemical performance in Li-O-2 cells in comparison with mesoporous carbon nitride and hard carbon. Tungsten carbide-1 (WC-1) with larger specific surface area promotes reversible formation and decomposition of Li2O2 at the cathode and lower charge overpotential (about 0.93 V) at 100 mA g(-1), which allows the Li-O-2 cell to run up to 100 cycles. In addition, synergistic interaction between WC-1 and LiI could further decrease the charging overpotentials of Li-O-2 cells and improve the charge-discharge performances of the Li-O-2 cells. These results indicate that mesoporous electrocatalysts can be utilized as promising functional materials for Li-O-2 cells to decrease overpotentials.
Template-free large-scale synthesis of g-C3N4 microtubes for enhanced visible light-driven photocatalytic H-2 production	A template-free hydrothermal-assisted thermal polymerization method has been developed for the large-scale synthesis of one-dimensional (1D) graphitic carbonnitride (g-C3N4) microtubes. The g-C3N4 microtubes were obtained by simple thermal polymerization of melamine-cyanuric acid complex microrods under N-2 atmosphere, which were synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of melamine solution at 180 A degrees C for 24 h. The as-obtained g-C3N4microtubes exhibited a large surface area and a unique one-dimensional tubular structure, which provided abundant active sites for proton reduction and also facilitated the electron transfer processes. As such, the g-C3N4 microtubes showed enhanced photocatalytic H-2 productionactivity in lactic acid aqueous solutions under visible light irradiation (lambda ae 420 nm), which was similar to 3.1 times higher than that of bulk g-C3N4 prepared by direct thermal polymerization of the melamine precursor under the same calcination conditions.
Directional transfer of photocarriers on CdS/g-C3N4 heterojunction modified with Pd as a cocatalyst for synergistically enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production	The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, in which cocatalysts have a great importance, is considered an influential way for the generation of hydrogen. In this work, to develop the hydrogen evolution efficiency, as a facile and efficient photocatalyst is CdS nanoparticles were synthesized over the g-C3N4 sheets by hydrothermal method and then Pd metallic nanoparticles were doped onto the nanocomposite using the borohyride reduction method which is an effective and short-term deposition procesess for visible light-response hydrogen generation from water. Considering the experimental results, with the doping of Pd nanoparticles on the type II heterojuction structure formed as a result of the combination of CdS and g-C3N4, the recombination of the charge carriers is delayed, interfacial charge transfer is accelerated and more visible light absorption is achieved, resulting in increased production of photocatalytic hydrogen. The hydrogen evolution rate is 293.0 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1) over Pd-CdS/g-C3N4, which is 3.02, 3.15, 12.0 and 69.8 times as that of CdS/g-C3N4, Pd/CdS, CdS and g-C3N4, respectively. This study is expected to shed light on the development of more efficient and stable noble metal cocatalyst-supported type II semiconductor heterogeneous systems for effective photocatalytic hydrogen generation applications.
Fabrication of g-C3N4/TiO2 composite photocatalyst with extended absorption wavelength range and enhanced photocatalytic performance	Not only for utilizing both ultraviolet (UV) and visible light but also for enhancing photoinduced carriers separation capability, a composite photocatalyst composed of graphite-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and TiO2 has been successfully prepared by an acetic acid assisted sol-gel method combined with calcination process. The as-prepared g-C3N4/TiO2 composite photocatalyst was characterized by using XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, FF-IR spectra, UV-DRS and TGA. Combined XRD results with SEM images, it indicated that the obtained anatase TiO2 nanoparticles dispersed well on the surface of g-C3N4 sheets and the aggregation degree of TiO2 nanoparticles could be effectively alleviated due to the introduction of g-C3N4. The results of UV-DRS further displayed that the optical absorption edge of g-C3N4/TiO2 composites had an obvious red shift to the longer wavelength in comparison with pure TiO2. Profiting from the above-mentioned advantages, g-C3N4/TiO2 composite showed excellent photocatalytic performance. Under visible light irradiation, all g-C3N4/TiO2 composite samples had more excellent photodegradation performance than pure g-C3N4 or TiO2, and the pseudo-first-order kinetic constant of methyl orange (MO) degradation on optimal g-C3N4/TiO2 composite was 2.80 times as great as that on pure g-C3N4. The photodegradation performance of optimal g-C3N4/TiO2 composite was also investigated under UV-vis light irradiation. Compared with the pure phase (TiO2 or g-C3N4), the composite photocatalytic capability was remarkably enhanced by coupling TiO2 with g-C3N4, which mainly benefited from the effective separation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs and the extended optical absorption range, both owing to the heterojunction built-in between g-C3N4 and TiO2.

Enhancement of visible light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution by bio-mimetic C-doped graphitic carbon nitride	Bio-mimetic C-doped graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with mesoporous microtubular structure has been prepared by a simple chemical wet bio-template impregnation approach (direct impregnation and hydrothermal impregnation) using urea as a precursor and kapok fibre as bio-template and in-situ carbon dopant. Our finding indicated that the hydrothermal impregnation had induced more in-situ C-doping in g-C3N4 as compared to the direct impregnation approach. The introduction of in-situ C-doping in the g-C3N4 and the mesoporous microtubular structure remarkably enhanced light-harvesting capability up to near infrared regions. The photocurrent measurement and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis suggested that the bio-template C-doped g-C3N4 exhibits a superior photoinduced electron-hole pairs separation efficiency due to C-doping and mesoporous microtubular structure significantly promotes excellent conductivity and electron redistribution in the sample. C-doped graphitic carbon nitride sample prepared by the hydrothermal (HB/g-C3N4) approach exhibits excellent photocatalytic hydrogen production with an H-2 production rate of 216.8 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) which was a 1.3 and 2.9 improvement over C-doped graphitic carbon nitride prepared by direct impregnation (DB/g-C3N4) and pristine g-C3N4, respectively. This study provides new insights into the development of low-cost and sustainable photocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen production. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Superior visible light driven photocatalytic degradation of fluoroquinolone drug norfloxacin over novel NiWO4 nanorods anchored on g-C3N4 nanosheets	A heterojunction nanocomposite NiWO4@g-C3N4 photocatalyst was designed by simple hydrothermal method and followed by sonication method. The structure, optical, surface area and morphological properties of the as synthesized photocatalyst were broadly investigated by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS), Brunauer Emmet Teller (BET), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The photocatalytic performance of the as-designed samples was studied based on the photo-degradation of norfloxacin (NRF) under visible light irradiation. As compared, the photocatalytic activity of NiWO4@g-C3N4 nanocomposite higher than that of single phase of g-C3N4 and NiWO4. The optimal NRF degradation rate of the synthesized nanocomposite was reached at 0.0547, which is 3.59 times higher than that of g-C3N4. Based on the result, enhancement of photocatalytic activity was attributed to the efficient visible light absorption, large surface area and retard charge carriers separation. Hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-.) and hole (h(+)) were played crucial role in the photocatalytic degradation process, it systematically explained by trapping experiments.
2D-montmorillonite-dispersed g-C3N4/TiO2 2D/0Dnanocomposite for enhanced photo-induced H-2 evolution from glycerol-water mixture	Montmorillonite (MMT) dispersed g-C3N4/TiO2 hybrid nanocomposite for enhanced photo-catalytic hydrogen production from glycerol-water mixture has been investigated. The newly designed composite photo-catalysts were fabricated through a sol-gel assisted hydrothermal method and were characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM, EDX, TEM, FTIR, UV-Vis, Raman and PL spectroscopy. Well-designed g-C3N4/MMT/TiO2 heterojunction composite was obtained with 2D MMT structure, which promoted both visible light absorption and hindered charges recombination rate. The modification of 2D/0D g-C3N4/TiO2 heterojunction with 2D MMT sheets enhances H-2 production due to MMT works as a mediator for effective charges trapping and transportation within the composite structure. The g-C3N4/MMT/TiO2 photo-catalyst exhibits highest H-2 production of 4425 ppm h(-1) g(-1) at pH 7.0, which was 2.12 times higher than the pure TiO2 (2085 ppm h(-1) g(-1)). In addition, increasing catalyst loading promotes more H-2 evolution and among the different sacrificial reagents, glycerol-water mixture gave highest H-2 production due to the presence of alpha-hydrogen atoms attached to carbon atoms. The enhanced photocatalytic efficiency can be attributed to synergistic effect of MMT with g-C3N4/TiO2 heterojunction composite, appropriate band structure and transportation of electrons-holes with their hindered recombination rate. These composite catalysts exhibited excellent photo-catalytic stability for H-2 production in cyclic runs. Possible reaction mechanism for hydrogen production over g-C3N4/MMT/TiO2 composite has been explained based on the experimental results. The finding of this work would be fruitful for hydrogen production applications with all sustainable systems.

An ultratrace assay of arsenite based on the synergistic quenching effect of Ru(bpy) 32+ and arsenite on the electrochemiluminescence of Au-g-C3N4 nanosheets	A novel ratiometric electrochemiluminescence (ECL) indicator has been constructed for ultratrace As(iii) detection based on the synergistic quenching of ECL emission of Au-g-C3N4 NSs using As(iii) and Ru(bpy)32+, meanwhile generating a new ECL signal of Ru(bpy)32+ with an increased intensity. Due to the dual quenching effect of As(iii) and Ru(bpy)32+ coupled with the generation of the second ECL signal of Ru(bpy)32+, the sensitivity and selectivity for detecting As(iii) are vastly enhanced.
Intramolecular Charge Transfer and Extended Conjugate Effects in Donor-π-Acceptor-Type Mesoporous Carbon Nitride for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution	Inspired by donor-acceptor (D-A) polymers in organic solar cell and the extended conjugation effect, a conceptual design of D-π-A-type mesoporous carbon nitride with benzene or thiophene as a π-spacer is proposed as an efficient photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution. The photocatalyst was successfully synthesized by a one-pot thermopolymerization based on nucleophilic substitution and a Schiff-base chemical reaction. On the molecular level, the insertion of an in-plane benzene as a π-spacer by forming covalent bonds C=N (acceptor) and C-N (donor) interrupts the continuity of tri-s-triazine units and maintains the intrinsic π-π conjugated electronic system. Synchronously, the enlarged electron delocalization and the intramolecular charge transfer induced by polarization provide force-directed migration of electrons, leading to boosted optical absorption capability and enhanced photogenerated carrier separation. With the synergistic effects of the mesoporous structure and excellent optical and electronic properties, a fivefold increase in the H2 evolution rate compared with that of pristine g-C3 N4 was achieved with robust performance. In addition, other simple aromatic heterocyclic compounds (e.g., pyridine, thiophene and furan)-based D-π-A structures with a higher hydrogen evolution rate (up to sevenfold increase) were also explored to broaden the application for the design of novel photocatalysts.
Tuning nanosheet Fe2O3 photoanodes with C3N4 and p-type CoOx decoration for efficient and stable water splitting	Fe2O3 photoanodes are ideal candidates for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. However, the charge recombination in the bulk and at the photoanode/electrolyte interface decreases their PEC performance. Here, C3N4 and p-type CoOx are firstly decorated on Fe2O3 nanosheets for PEC performance enhancement and mechanism study. The photocurrent densities of Fe2O3/C3N4 and Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx photoanodes are about 1.6 and 2 times at 1.23 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) compared with that of the Fe2O3 film (0.74 mA cm(-2)) under simulated sun light irradiation. Correspondingly, their photocurrent onset potentials are negatively shifted by about 0.09 and 0.19 V compared with that of Fe2O3 (0.81 V-RHE). The solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency reaches 0.17% and the incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) achieves 81.7% at 385 nm for the Fe2O3/C3N4/CoOx hybrid photoanode. The matched band alignments between Fe2O3 and C3N4 result in more efficient charge separation, and the p-type CoOx cocatalyst reduces surface recombination and shows quicker water oxidation reaction kinetics at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface.
Synthesis of Ag2CrO4/SnO2 n-n type heterojunction as a visible light photocatalyst for degradation of rhodamine B	The Ag2CrO4/SnO2 n-n type heterojunction has been fabricated by coupling Ag2CrO4 particles with SnO2 nanorods via an in situ synthetic method. The photocatalytic degradation mechanism of the as-prepared heterojunction has also been discussed. Characterization results revealed that the as-fabricated Ag2CrO4/SnO2 composites could reinforce the photo-degradation competencies for rhodamine B dilute solution compared to pure Ag2CrO4 and SnO2 samples. As the increase in the molar ratios of Ag2CrO4-SnO2, the photocatalytic degradation efficiency appeared to the tendency of first increasing and then decreasing. When it was 4:10, in 90min, the as-obtained samples possessed the vintage photocatalytic degradation efficiency of 95.8% among of pure SnO2, Ag2CrO4 and the as-prepared composites with various molar ratios, respectively. Furthermore, the Ag2CrO4 and SnO2 were connected via chemical bonds to form the homogenous heterojunction. It could boost the separation and transfer of the photogenerated holes and electrons. In addition, the holes, hydroxyl and superoxide radicals played a major role during the photodegradation process.
Cross-Linked Graphitic Carbon Nitride with Photonic Crystal Structure for Efficient Visible-Light-Driven Photocatalysis	Highly cross-linked graphitic carbon nitride has been prepared by a thermal copolymerization of dicyanodiamide with tetramethylammonium salts. The cross-linking can be evidenced by (i) increased C/N ratio without new carbon species, (ii) decreased specific surface area, and (iii) Tyndall effect after dissolution in concentrated sulfuric acid. The cross-linked graphitic carbon nitride with photonic crystal structure has highly efficient photocatalytic activity for water splitting under visible light due to the synergistic enhancement by the greatly suppressed photoluminescence, red-shifted absorption edges, strong inner reflections, and effective PCs stop band overlaps. It exhibits an enhanced photodegradation kinetic of methyl orange and a high visible-light-driven hydrogen-evolution rate of 166.9 μmol h-1 (25 times higher than that of the pristine graphitic carbon nitride counterpart). This work presents a facile method for designing and developing high-performance graphitic carbon nitride photocatalysts, providing a broad range of application prospects in the fields of electronics and energy conversion.
Influence of Pt and P doping on the performance of g-C3N4 monolayer	Density functional theory (DFT) is used to find out the effect of platinum and phosphorus doping (as individuals and together) on the structural, electronic as well as optical performance of heptazine based graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) monolayer. The calculated bandgap value for the pristine g-C3N4 is 1.2 eV. In the case of Pt doping delocalization of the frontier molecular orbitals (MO) are not adequate, but P doping as individual and together with Pt results in strong delocalization of frontier MOs. Pt and P co-doping provides two new paths, for the relocation of photogenerated charge carriers between adjacent heptazine units. Furthermore, there is a magnified optical absorption in the ultraviolet as well as the infrared region and improved electronic movement in co-doped g-C3N4. Optical conductivity is enhanced by approximately 40% at 200 nm after the co-doping. A decrease in the work function value is also observed in doped g-C3N4 with the minimum amount for Pt and P co-doping. Thus Pt/P co-doping process may be considered as a tool to upgrade the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 monolayer.
Fabrication of CuS/CuO nanowire heterostructures on copper mesh with improved visible light photocatalytic properties	CuS/CuO nanowire heterostructures grown on copper mesh (CuS/CuO/Cu) have been successfully synthesized by a liquid-solid reaction at room temperature followed by annealing. The proposed structure has been verified by X-ray diffraction analysis. Scanning electron microscopy images have indicated that the density and diameter of CuS nanoparticles on CuO nanowires can be tuned by controlling the duration of sulfonation with Na2S. Photocatalytic studies have revealed that CuS/CuO/Cu heterostructures offer improved photocatalytic activity in the degradation of Methylene Blue (MB) in the presence of H2O2. A sample designated as CuS/CuO/Cu-10, where "10" denotes sulfonation with Na2S for 10 min, showed the best photocatalytic properties, with MB degradation efficiencies under visible light irradiation of 87.4% after 20 min and 98.6% after 40 min. The enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to effective electron-hole separation and improved visible light utilization due to the cooperative effect of the CuS/CuO heterostructures and conductive copper mesh.
4-in-1 Fe3O4/g-C3N4@PPy-DOX nanocomposites: Magnetic targeting guided trimode combinatorial chemotherapy/PDT/PTT for cancer.	At present, cancer has become a major disease threatening human health worldwide. Therefore, developing targeting guided multimode synergetic therapy has become one of the hot spots in current antitumor research and is also a great challenge. Herein, a new Fe3O4/g-C3N4@PPy-DOX nanocomposite containing magnetic iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles (NPs), lamellar structure of graphite-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and polypyrrole (PPy) shell with the loaded anti-tumor drug doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) was designed and prepared. The monodisperse Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) with the diameter of 20nm endowed the nanocomposite with the magnetic targeting ability, reducing damage to normal tissues. It is very interesting that the Fe3O4 NPs also possessed photosensitizer function for photodynamic therapy (PDT). The g-C3N4 sheets as the photocatalysis towards the degradation of water for generating O2 could effectively improve the hypoxia of solid tumors and increase the efficiency of PDT. In addition, PPy has high light-to-heat conversion efficiency, so was chosen for the cancer photothermal therapy (PTT). Finally, an anticancer drug (DOX) was loaded on the nanocomposite because the presence of mesoporous structure. Thus, the prepared Fe3O4/g-C3N4@PPy-DOX nanocomposites exhibit synergetic chemotherapy/PTT/enhanced PDT antitumor effect. This study provides an inspiration for combining targeting and multimodality to improve the anticancer efficiency. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
Integrating the merits of two-dimensional structure and heteroatom modification into semiconductor photocatalyst to boost NO removal	In this work, taking graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as an example, the synergistic utilization of the advantages of two-dimensional (2D) structure and heteroatom modification is realized. To better understand the role of such structure tailoring, the complicated photocatalytic reaction involving multiple small molecules, namely NO removal, is selected to serve as a model reaction. The experimental results find that the 2D g-C3N4 with oxygen modification (2D OCN) exhibits enhanced performance with good stability in photocatalytic NO removal compared to pristine g-C3N4, as a result for the improved charge separation and optimized molecular adsorption. On one hand, the 2D structure of OCN can shorten the charge migration distance, endow the semiconductor improved redox ability and provide large specific area for reaction proceeding. On the other hand, the oxygen modification could optimize the adsorption ability of reaction molecules (NO and O-2) benefiting the surface catalytic reaction. All the merits mentioned above are supported by detailed characterization and theoretical calculation. This article presented here provides a case study for designing efficient photocatalyst and an approach to analyze the correlation between structure and performance.
Efficient persulfate non-radical activation of electron-rich copper active sites induced by oxygen on graphitic carbon nitride	Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) non-radical reactions possess high catalytic activity for specific pollutants under complex water environments. However, the synthesis of high-performance catalysts and the discussion of non-radical reaction mechanisms are still unsatisfactory. Here, a novel and efficient non-radical catalyst (O-CuCN) was successfully assembled using the scheme of Copper (Cu) and oxygen (O) co-doping. The O element with great electronegativity induces graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) to act as a medium to change the phase properties and electron density distribution of g-C3N4, and provides a support for the targeting of Cu. Cu is introduced into g-C3N4 as an active site in the phase structure, and an electron-rich center with the Cu site is formed, which forms a metastable intermediate after the adsorption of PMS by Cu as the active site. The new catalyst O-CuCN has outstanding activity in the PMS system, and its degradation rate for bisphenol A (BPA) is increased by more than 20 times compared to that of g-C3N4, and it has excellent environmental tolerance and stability. This work demonstrates that the formation of metastable intermediates and the initiation of effective non-radical reactions can be achieved by constructing differentiated electron density structures.

A facile method for the preparation of N6-substituted ATP-Sepharose	The attachment of 6-methylsulfonylpurineribose 5'-triphosphate to AH-Sepharose 4B as a facile method for the preparation of ATP-Sepharose is described. This reaction is compared to the coupling of 6-chloropurineriboside 5'-triphosphate as well as N(6)-aminocaproyl-ATP. An improved synthesis of purineriboside 5'-phosphates which does not require purification by column chromatography is also described.
A novel Z-scheme g- C3N4/LaCoO3 heterojunction with enhanced photocatalytic activity in degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride	A novel Z-scheme g-C3N4/LaCoO3 photocatalyst was prepared by a facial mixing-heating and precipitation method. Doping g-C3N4 on LaCoO3, the heterojunction exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance and stability compared with bare LaCoO3 in the degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC). The enhanced photocatalytic activity are attributed to the high separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs by the formation of Z-scheme heterojunction structure. The photocatalytic degradation rate of TC is up to 92% and the kinetic rate constant (k) of the optimal g-C3N4/LaCoO3 composite is about 14.5 times and 2.3 times of that of bare LaCoO3 and g-C3N4, respectively.
Poly(methyl methacrylate)-derived graphene films on different substrates using rapid thermal process: a way to control the film properties through the substrate and polymer layer thickness	Increasing interest and applications for graphene and carbon-based films emphasize the need for economical synthesizing techniques. We report a facile and novel synthesis method to prepare graphene, graphitic carbon, graphitic carbon nitride composite layers depending upon the spin-coated poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer layer and substrate used. Few and multilayer graphene sheets were formed on SiO2 covered Si substrate using a simple rapid thermal annealing process. We examined hot plate and rapid thermal annealing using a nickel capping layer and found that the rapid thermal process converted PMMA into graphene efficiently. The resultant graphitic films were characterized using FESEM, HRTEM, XRD and Laser Raman. Current-voltage response of the prepared graphene layers was analyzed fabricating as two terminal devices. The thickness of the formed layer depended on PMMA layer thickness, and the metal capping layer was crucial for converting PMMA into graphene. This polymer conversion method to fabricate graphene layers will be attractive for many graphene applications due to its versatility. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
Low-temperature synthesis of highly transparent carbon nitride thin films	Highly transparent carbon nitride thin films have been prepared on transparent plastic substrates at low temperatures by radio frequency reactive magnetron sputtering of a graphite target in the plasmas of pure nitrogen and nitrogen-hydrogen gas mixtures. The amorphous films thus obtained have been characterized for their optical transmittance by spectrophotometry, revealing a very high transparency in the visible region of the spectrum. The chemical composition and bonding states of a sample studied by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed that nitrogen has been predominately bonded to sp(3)-hybridized carbon, in addition to a small amount of sp(2)-hybridization. The elemental concentration was measured to be C=51.1 at.%, N=43.2 at.%, and O=5.7 at.%. The N/C ratio for the N-sp(3)C component is calculated to be 1.29, close to the expected stoichiometric value of 1.33 for beta-C3N4. Compared to the unhydrogenated C-N thin films, the hydrogenated samples exhibited increased optical transmittance, about 90% in the whole of the visible spectrum. Such transmittance characteristics of the hydrogenated C-N films closely matched those exhibited by the plastic substrate.
Conformational analysis of the hydrophobic peptide alphas1-casein(136-196)	Hydrophobic interactions are important in the self-association of milk proteins, including alphas1-casein. The extent to which casein interaction sites are influenced by local secondary structure is not widely known. Both primary amino acid sequence and local secondary structure are shown to affect the self-association of the hydrophobic peptide alphas1-casein(136-196). The peptide is aggregated at low concentrations (7 microM and above), as determined by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements at pH 6.0 in phosphate buffer. Increase in temperature is shown to induce side chain mobility (melting) as indicated by both 1H NMR and near-UV circular dichroism (CD) measurements. As determined by far-UV CD, there is also a loss in the global amount of extended structure with increasing temperature, while beta-turn structures and some aromatic dichroism are conserved at temperatures as high as 70 degrees C. Similar retention of structure occurs at pH 2 and in 6 M guanidine HCl. The observed stability of beta-turns and some side chains in alphas1-casein(136-196) supports previous assumptions that hydrophobic, proline-based turns are important interaction sites in the self-association of alphas1-casein, and possibly in the formation of the calcium transport complexes, the casein micelles. It may be speculated that these areas of the peptide represent a 'molten globule-like', heat stable, core structure for alphas1-casein.
In-situ synthesis of AgNbO 3/g-C3N4 photocatalyst via microwave heating method for efficiently photocatalytic H 2 generation	This paper is designed for elevating the photocatalytic H2-evoultion performance of g-C3N4 through the modification of AgNbO3 nanocubes. Via the microwave heating method, g-C3N4 was in-situ formed on AgNbO3 surface to fabricate a close contact between the two semiconductors in forty minutes. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were performed to confirm the binary structure of the synthesized AgNbO3/g-C3N4 composite. N2-adsorption and visible diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS) analyses indicated that the addition of AgNbO3 to g-C3N4 showed nearly negligible influence on the specific surface area and the optical property. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy experiment suggested that the AgNbO3/g-C3N4 displayed reduced PL emission and longer lifetime of photoexcited charge carriers than g-C3N4, which could be ascribed to the suitable band potential and the intimate contact of g-C3N4 and AgNbO3. This result was also confirmed by the transient photocurrent response experiment. The influence of the enhanced charge separation was displayed in their photocatalytic reaction. AgNbO3/g-C3N4 sample showed enhanced performance in photocatalytic H2-generation under visible light illumination. The H2-evolution rate is determined to be 88 μmol·g-1·h-1, which reaches 2.0 times of g-C3N4. This study provides a feasible and rapid approach to fabricate g-C3N4 based composite.
A SERS substrate of mesoporous g-C3N4 embedded with in situ grown gold nanoparticles for sensitive detection of 6-thioguanine	A novel surface-enhanced Raman scattering substrate was developed through in situ growing gold nanoparticles inside the mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride with a large surface area. The mesoporous structure afforded support for loading more gold nanoparticles, defined the nanoparticle diameter and ensured uniform distribution of the nanoparticles. Crystal violet used as a Raman probe was detected by SERS based on the hybrids with an enhancement factor of 5.0 x 10(5), and the relative standard deviation of the peak intensity (at 1174 cm(-1) and 1618 cm(-1)) were 6.2% and 6.1% (n = 30) for solid samples, and 5.1% and 5.0% (n = 11) for liquid samples. The high SERS activity was attributed to abundant hot spots formed by high-density gold nanoparticles and chemical enhancement from mpg-C3N4, and the good reproducibility was due to controlled size and uniform distribution of the gold nanoparticles. An antineoplastic drug, 6-thioguanine was detected with a wide linear range from 0.60 mu M to 48 mu M and a low detection limit of 0.24 mu M. The mesoporous g-C3N4 embedded with gold nanoparticles significantly improved the SERS sensitivity and reproducibility for 6-thioguanine detection, and it holds promising potential in noninvasive and ultrasensitive drug monitoring.

In Situ Co-Crystallization for Fabrication of g-C3N4/Bi5O7I Heterojunction for Enhanced Visible-Light Photocatalysis	We developed for the first tithe an in situ co-crystallization route for fabrication of a heterojunctional photocatalyst g-C3N4/Bi5O7I by adopting melamine and BiOI as coprecursors. This synthetic Method enables intimate interfacial interaction with chemical bonding between g-C3N4 and Bi5O7I, which is beneficial for charge transfer at the interface. The photocatalysis properties of g-C3N4/Bi5O7I composites were studied by photodegradation of Rhodarnine B (RhB) and phenol and generation of transient photocurrent with illumination of visible-light (lambda > 420 nm), The results revealed that the g-C3N4/Bi5O7I composite shows enhanced photocatalytic reactivity compared to the pristine g-C3N4 and Bi5O7I samples. Investigations on the behaviors of charge carriers via electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra suggests that the g-C3N4/Bi5O7I heterojunctional structure constructed of the in situ cothermolysis approach is responsible for the efficient separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons (e(-)) and holes (h(+)), thus giving rise to the higher photocatalytic activity. The present work opens a new avenue for manipulation of high-performance semiconductor heterojunction for photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical application.
Controllable Fabrication of Heterogeneous p-TiO2 QDs@g-C3N4 p-n Junction for Efficient Photocatalysis	Photocatalytic technology has been considered to be an ideal approach to solve the energy and environmental crises, and TiO2 is regarded as the most promising photocatalyst. Compared with bare TiO2, TiO2 based p-n heterojunction exhibits a much better performance in charge separation, light absorption and photocatalytic activity. Herein, we developed an efficient method to prepare p-type TiO2 quantum dots (QDs) and decorated graphitic carbonitrile (g-C3N4) nanocomposites, while the composition and structure of the TiO2@g-C3N4 were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy characterizations. The characterization results reveal the surface decorated TiO2 quantum dots is decomposed by titanium glycerolate, which exhibits p-type conductivity. The presence of p-n heterojunction over interface is confirmed, and photoluminescence results indicate a better performance in transfer and separation of photo-generated charge carriers than pure semiconductors and type-II heterojunction. Moreover, the synergy of p-n heterojunction over interface, strong interface interaction, and quantum-size effect significantly contributes to the promoted performance of TiO2 QDs@g-C3N4 composites. As a result, the as-fabricated TiO2 QDs@g-C3N4 composite with a p/n mass ratio of 0.15 exhibits improved photo-reactivity of 4.3-fold and 5.4-fold compared to pure g-C3N4 in degradation of organic pollutant under full solar spectrum and visible light irradiation, respectively.
Sonochemically exfoliated graphitic-carbon nitride for the electrochemical detection of flutamide in environmental samples	This study describes the synthesis of exfoliation of graphitic-carbon nitride (g-C3N4) using thermal polymerization technique followed by sonochemical method. The as-prepared g-C3N4 was characterized by various techniques, such as X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDS), and transmission electron microscope (TEM) to investigate the structural and morphology of g-C3N4. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements were demonstrated excellent electrocatalytic activity of exfoliated g-C3N4 modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) towards flutamide (FLT) detection which affords from their superior conductivity, porous structure, and large accessible surface area. It is evident from the comparison study of bulk g-C3N4, the exfoliated g-C3N4 was greatly exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic performance for electrochemical detection of FLT. The DPV results of exfoliated g-C3N4/GCE for electrochemical detection of FLT reveals low detection limit (LOD) of 0.05 mu M and sensitivity of 1.166 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2) towards wide linear range of 2-1208 mu M. Finally, the modified electrode also showed excellent selectivity, and reproducibility, which accessed as a potential for the electrochemical detection of FLT in environmental samples.
Identification of antibody epitopes within the CB-11 peptide of type II collagen. I: Detection of antibody binding sites by epitope scanning	Using epitope scanning, the precise location of antibody binding sites on the CB-11 peptide of bovine type II collagen have been identified for the first time. Two hundred and seventy two peptides (8 amino acids in length and overlapping by seven amino acids), representing the complete CB-11 sequence, were synthesised on solid phase supports, in duplicate, and were screened with sera from arthritic and non-arthritic, bovine type II collagen-immunised rats. A total of twenty one different antibody binding sites were identified with no epitope being uniquely recognised by sera from arthritic, as compared to non-arthritic, rats although differences in the relative amount of antibody binding were seen. Individual sera identified between two and thirteen epitopes with one epitope being recognised by all sera. Some of the amino acid sequences, of the CB-11 region of bovine type II collagen, recognised by the rat sera are identical to the sequences in human type II collagen and thus these epitopes may be relevant to autoimmunity to type II collagen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
In vivo phosphorylation sites in fetal and adult rat tau	Fetal tau and tau in paired helical filaments show similar immunoreactivities with several phosphorylation-dependent paired helical filament-polyclonals and monoclonals, suggesting that the two molecules share several distinct phosphorylated epitopes. To make clear the similarities and differences between the two, we have undertaken work to identify the in vivo phosphorylation sites in fetal rat tau. We have approached this problem by identifying phosphopeptides by means of mass spectrometry and sequencing of those phosphopeptides after modification with ethanethiol. Although remarkable heterogeneity was present, fetal tau was found to bear at most 10 phosphates at Ser-189, Ser-190, Ser-193, Ser-226, Ser-387, Ser-395, Thr-172, Thr-222, and, presumably, Ser-391 and Thr-208 (numbering is according to the longest form of rat tau; Kosik, K. S., Orecchio, L. D., Bakalis, S., and Neve, R. L. (1989) Neuron 2, 1389-1397). In contrast, adult rat tau was much less phosphorylated; only Thr-172, Ser-190, Ser-193, Thr-222, and Ser-395 were phosphorylated to a slight-to-moderate extent. All these sites except for Ser-189 and Ser-391 were followed by Pro residues. Thus, tau is an in vivo substrate for proline-directed protein kinase(s), and its phosphorylation state is developmentally regulated.
Synthesis of novel MoS2/g-C3N4nanocomposites for enhanced photocatalytic activity	So far, the synthesis of high-activity and low-cost photocatalysts remains a huge challenge. 3D flower-like MoS2/g-C3N4hybrids were synthesized by a very simple method. All of them were characterized by various characterizations to determine the composition, morphology, and properties of the compounds. There are many sites with large specific surface area catalytic activity in this structure. These composites are all photocatalytic degradable organic dyes, and the photocatalytic properties of the flower-like 4% MoS2/g-C3N4are the best. The stability and recyclability of the 4% MoS2/g-C3N4photocatalyst are also excellent. The 4% MoS2/g-C3N4can also have photocatalytic ability to produce hydrogen. 50 mg of 4% MoS2/g-C3N4photocatalyst can produce about 156 umol of hydrogen with visible light irradiation for about 4 h. Rate of hydrogen production is about 780 mu mol h(- 1) g(- 1). In view of the good photocatalytic performance of the catalyst, we have discussed the mechanism both photocatalytic degradation of organic harmful pollutants and photocatalytic hydrogen production.
Controlling Monomer Feeding Rate to Achieve Highly Crystalline Covalent Triazine Frameworks	The synthesis of highly crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with ultrastrong covalent bonds (aromatic C=N) from the triazine linkage presents a great challenge to synthetic chemists. Herein, the synthesis of highly crystalline CTFs via directly controlling the monomer feeding rate is reported. By tuning the feeding rate of monomers, the crystallization process can be readily governed in a controlled manner in an open system. The sample of CTF-HUST-HCl with abundant exposed {001} crystal facets has the better crystallinity and thus is selected to study the effect of high crystallinity on photoelectric properties. Owing to the better separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and charge transfer, the obtained highly ordered CTFHUST-HC1 has superior performance in the photocatalytic removal of nitric oxide (NO) than its lesser crystalline counterparts and g-C3N4.
Class III human liver alcohol dehydrogenase: a novel structural type equidistantly related to the class I and class II enzymes	The primary structure of class III alcohol dehydrogenase (dimeric with chi subunits) from human liver has been determined by peptide analyses. The protein chain is a clearly distinct type of subunit distantly related to those of both human class I and class II alcohol dehydrogenases (with alpha, beta, gamma, and pi subunits, respectively). Disregarding a few gaps, residue differences in the chi protein chain with respect to beta 1 and pi occur at 139 and 140 positions, respectively. Compared to class I, the 373-residue chi structure has an extra residue, Cys after position 60, and two missing ones, the first two residues relative to class I, although the N-terminus is acetylated like that for those enzymes. The chi subunit contains two more tryptophan residues than the class I subunits, accounting for the increased absorbance at 280 nm. There are also four additional acidic and two fewer basic side chains than in the class I beta structure, compatible with the markedly different electrophoretic mobility of the class III enzyme. Residue differences between class III and the other classes occur with nearly equal frequency in the coenzyme-binding and catalytic domains. The similarity in the number of exchanges relative to that of the enzymes of the other two classes supports conclusions that the three classes of alcohol dehydrogenase reflect stages in the development of separate enzymes with distinct functional roles. In spite of the many exchanges, the residues critical to basic functional properties are either completely unchanged--all zinc ligands and space-restricted Gly residues--or partly unchanged--residues at the coenzyme-binding pocket.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Plasmonic Bi Metal Deposition and g-C3N4 Coating on Bi2WO6 Microspheres for Efficient Visible-Light Photocatalysis	A low-cost semiconductor-based photocatalyst using visible light energy has attracted increasing interest for energy generation and environmental remediation. Herein, plasmonic Bi metal was deposited in situ in g-C3N4@Bi2WO6 microspheres via a hydrothermal method. As an electron-conduction bridge, metallic Bi was inserted as the interlayer between gC3N4 and the surface of Bi2WO6 microspheres to enhance visible light absorption due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect and facilitate efficient electron-carrier separation. Different characterization techniques, including XRD, SEM, TEM, UV-vis, XPS, photoluminescence, and photocurrent generation, were employed to investigate the morphology and optical properties of the as-prepared samples. The results indicated that the g-C3N4(20%)@Bi@Bi2WO6 microsphere sample exhibited an extraordinary enhanced photocatalytic activity, higher than those of the g-C3N4, Bi2WO6, and g-C3N4(20%)@Bi2WO6 samples. It implies that the heterostructured combination of g-C3N4, metallic Bi, and Bi2WO6 microspheres provided synergistic photocatalytic activity via an efficient electron transfer process. On the basis of the results, a possible photocatalytic mechanism of the as-prepared samples was proposed. The present study demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing low-cost metallic Bi as a substitute for noble metals to design a doped photocatalysis composite with enhanced photocatalytic performance.
First-principle investigation on charge carrier transfer in transition-metal single atoms loaded g-C3N4	The decoration by transition-metal single atoms shows great potential in enhancing the photocatalytic performance of semiconductors. Nevertheless, the factors accounting for this enhancement remain unknown. Herein, single atoms (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) loaded g-C3N4 were used as prototypes to investigate the mechanism through density functional theory (DFT). The results indicate that Fe, Co and Ni single atoms are inclined to penetrate into g-C3N4, prolonging the charge carrier migration distance. Furthermore, these single atoms can act as bridge to promote charge carrier transfer across g-C3N4 interlamination through the reconstitution of molecular orbitals. Among these five metals, built-in electric field is created in Fe/g-C3N4 and Co/g-C3N4 models, effectively suppressing the recombination of electron-hole pairs. In contrast, Cu and Zn atoms can only be loaded on the g-C3N4 surface, contributing trivial to the interlayer charge carrier migration. Our work provides theoretical support for the study of transition-metal single atom/g-C3N4 systems and gives new insight into the photocatalytic performance enhancement.
One-step facile synthesis and high H-2-evolution activity of suspensible CdxZn1-xS nanocrystal photocatalysts in a S2-/SO32- system	For a CdS-based photocatalyst, both the photocorrosion resistance and the rapid H-2-production reaction are highly required for improving its photocatalytic H-2-production performance. In this study, a facile strategy was reported to simultaneously realize an improved photocorrosion resistance and rapid interfacial H-2-evolution reaction of CdxZn1-xS solid-solution photocatalysts in a sulfur-rich S2-/SO32- solution. Here, the suspensible CdxZn1-xS nanocrystal photocatalysts are prepared by a one-step co-precipitation route through the direct introduction of Zn2+/Cd2+ mixing ions in a sulfur-rich Na2S-Na2SO3 solution, and the resultant CdxZn1-xS nanocrystals (ca. 5 nm) display a suspensible structure owing to the numerous and selective adsorption of S2-/SO32- on the surface of these CdxZn1-xS nanocrystals. It is found that the bandgap structure of CdxZn1-xS (from 2.25 to 3.52 eV) nanocrystals can be easily controlled by adjusting the Cd2+/Zn2+ molar ratio. The photocatalytic experimental results suggested that the suspensible CdxZn1-xS nanocrystal photocatalysts clearly displayed an excellent photocatalytic H-2-production performance, and the suspensible Cd0.6Zn0.4S nanocrystals exhibit the highest photocatalytic H-2-generation performance of 717.19 mol h(-1), a value higher than that of the sole CdS (320.99 mol h(-1)) and ZnS (5.89 mol h(-1)) by a factor of 2.2 and 121.8 times, respectively. Based on the experimental results, a possible S2- active site-mediated mechanism accounted for the high H-2-production activity of the suspensible CdxZn1-xS nanocrystals, namely the numerous adsorbed S2- ions not only function as efficient hole scavengers to rapidly consume the photogenerated holes, resulting in an improved photocorrosion resistance of suspensible CdxZn1-xS nanocrystals, but also serve as effective H+-capturing active sites to accelerate the interfacial H-2-production reaction. Meanwhile, an optimum bandgap structure of suspensible CdxZn1-xS nanocrystals is also extremely required for promoting the photocatalytic H-2-production activity. This research may provide advanced insights for developing stable and high-activity photocatalytic materials.
Graphitic C3N4-Sensitized TiO2 Nanotube Layers: A Visible-Light Activated Efficient Metal-Free Antimicrobial Platform	Herein, we use a facile procedure to graft a thin graphitic C3N4 (g-C3N4) layer on aligned TiO2 nanotube arrays (TiNT) by a one-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) approach. This provides a platform to enhance the visible-light response of TiO2 nanotubes for antimicrobial applications. The formed g-C3N4/TiNT binary nanocomposite exhibits excellent bactericidal efficiency against Escherichia coli (E. coli) as a visible-light activated antibacterial coating, without the use of additional bactericides.
Synthesis of MoS2/g-C3N4 nanocomposites with enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity for the removal of nitric oxide (NO)	Molybdenum disulfide and graphitic carbon nitride (MoS2-g-C3N4) nanocomposites with visible-light induced photocatalytic activity were successfully synthesized by a facile ultrasonic dispersion method. The crystalline structure and morphology of the MoS2-g-C3N4 nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microcopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The optical property of the as-prepared nanocomposites was studied by ultraviolet visible diffusion reflection (UV-vis) and photoluminescence(PL) spectrum. It could be observed from the TEM image that the MoS2 nanosheets and g-C3N4 nanoparticles were well combined together. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of MoS2-g-C3N4 composites was evaluated by the removal of nitric oxide under visible light irradiation (>400nm). The experimental results demonstrated that the nanocomposites with the MoS2 content of 1.5 wt% exhibited optimal photocatalytic activity and the corresponding removal rate of NO achieved 51.67%, higher than that of pure g-C3N4 nanoparticles. A possible photocatalytic mechanism for the MoS2-g-C3N4 nanocomposites with enhanced photocatalytic activity could be ascribed to the hetero-structure of MoS2 and g-C3N4.

Synthesis of Coralloid Carbon Nitride Polymers and Photocatalytic Selective Oxidation of Benzyl Alcohol.	Polymeric carbon nitride (C3N4) is currently the most potential nonmetallic photocatalyst, but it suffers from low catalytic activity due to rapid electron-hole recombination behavior and low specific surface area. The morphology control of C3N4 is one of effective methods to achieve higher photocatalytic performance. Here, the bulk, lamellar and coralloid C3N4 were synthesized by different chemical methods. The as-prepared coralloid C3N4 has a higher specific surface area (123.7 m2 g-1) than bulk (5.4 m2 g-1) and lamellar C3N4 (2.8 m2 g-1), thus exhibiting a 3.15 and 2.59 fold higher photocatalytic efficiency for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol than bulk and lamellar C3N4, respectively. Optical characterizations of photocatalysts suggest that coralloid C3N4 can effectively capture electrons and accelerate carrier separation, which is caused by the presence of more nitrogen vacancies. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that superoxide radical (O2-) and holes (h+) play a major role in the photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol using C3N4 as phocatalyst. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.
Bio-inspired Z-scheme g-C3N4/Ag 2 CrO 4 for efficient visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen generation	Due to low charge separation efficiency and poor stability, it is usually difficult for single-component photocatalysts such as graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and silver chromate (Ag2CrO4) to fulfill photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiently. Z-scheme charge transport mechanism that mimics the photosynthesis in nature is an effective way to solve the above problems. Inspired by photosynthesis, we report Ag2CrO4 nanoparticles-decorated g-C3N4 nanosheet as an efficient photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with methanol as sacrificial agent. The formation of Z-scheme g-C3N4/Ag2CrO4 nanosheets photocatalysts could inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, promote the generation of hydrogen by photosplitting of water. The experiment results indicate that g-C3N4/Ag2CrO4 nanocomposites present enhanced photocatalytic activity and stability in the H2 evolution of water splitting. And the nanocomposites g-C3N4/Ag2CrO4(23.1%) show the 14 times HER efficiency compared to that of bare g-C3N4.
A Cocrystal Precursor Strategy for Carbon-Rich Graphitic Carbon Nitride toward High-Efficiency Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting	Direct and efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting is crucial for the sustainable conversion and storage of renewable solar energy. Herein, we present the design of a carbon-rich graphitic carbon nitride (Cco-C3N4), prepared from a layered molecular cocrystal precursor. The cocrystal microsheets were synthesized using a facile hydrothermal process. Following two-step thermal treatment and liquid exfoliation, the product maintains the 2D morphology owing to the toptactic transformation process. The Cco-C3N4 exhibits an enhanced photogenerated electron-hole separation, high charge transport capacity, and prolonged lifetime of the carriers, relative to the g-C3N4 system. In the absence of any sacrificial reagent or co-catalyst, the Cco-C3N4 microsheets exhibit a high photocatalytic activity. The work presented in this report supplies a cocrystal route for the orderly molecular self-assembly of precursor materials to tailor the chemical compositions and electronic structures. Moreover, the generation of a highly efficient water-splitting photocatalyst has larger implications for sustainable energy applications.
Preparation of g-C3N4/TiO2/BiVO4 composite and its application in photocatalytic degradation of pollutant from TATB production under visible light irradiation	A novel and highly efficient ternary mpg-C3N4/BiVO4/TiO2 composite was successfully synthesized and characterized with regard to structure, chemical composition, optical properties and degradation application. The photocatalytic activities of as-prepared samples were evaluated by the photocatalytic decomposition of methylene blue (MB), practical effluent from alkylation and amination steps in 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB) production. Compared with TiO2, BiVO4, and mpg-C3N4, the binary composites TiO2/BiVO4 and the ternary mpg-C3N4/BiVO4/TiO2 composites exhibited the higher photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. Compared to solo mpg-C3N4 and BiVO4, the photocatalytic efficiency of g-C3N4/TiO2/BiVO4 raised up to 94%. The catalytic activity of g-C3N4/TiO2/BiVO4 against TATB (alkylation and amination) also confirms its efficiency by creating intermediate which were detected by Q-TOF-MS. The thermal stability and photo-stability of the produced composites were investigated. From the view of practical application, mpg-C3N4/BiVO4/TiO2 displayed superior photostability after five times recycle. The mechanism research showed the fitting of band structure among BiVO4, g-C3N4, and TiO2. The presence of mpg-C3N4 and BiVO4 can notably adjust the band gap energy and the synergy effects of them can prolong the lifetime of the charge carrier. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Phosphate group grafted twinned BiPO4 with significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity: Synergistic effect of improved charge separation efficiency and redox ability	The photocatalytic technology based on solar energy is a potential approach to mitigate environmental problem. The surface property of photocatalysts and the separation efficiency of photo-generated spatial charge are considerably important to enhance their photocatalytic activity in the decomposition of organic pollutants in wastewater. In this work, phosphate group grafted twinned BiPO4 with surface phase junction were controllably synthesized by a facile two-step method. XRD results showed that two crystal phases of nMBIP and mMBIP were formed in the twinned BiPO4. The formation of phase junction in BiPO4 was also validated by HRTEM. XPS spectra confirmed that PO43- successfully grafted on the surface of the twinned BiPO4. The apparent rate constants of the twinned BiPO4 for degradation of methylene blue (MB) and carbamazepine (CBZ) improved 5.3 and 5.0 times respectively compared to pristine BiPO4 because of the formed phase junction. After phosphate grafting on the surface of phase junction, the apparent rate constants for MB and CBZ degradation were further boosted, which were 3.0 and 5.2 times as high as that of twinned BiPO4. The photocatalytic intermediates of CBZ were detected by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS, and a deductive degradation pathway of CBZ was proposed. Transient photocurrent responses, PL and Mott-Schottky analysis verified that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of phosphate group grafted twinned BiPO4 with phase junction for the degradation of MB and CBZ was ascribed to faster transfer, efficient separation and improved redox ability of photo-induced charge carriers.
Intercalative hybridization of layered double hydroxide nanocrystals with mesoporous g-C3N4 for enhancing visible light-induced H 2 production efficiency	Efficient visible light active hybrid photocatalysts for H2 production can be synthesized by the intercalative hybridization of Zn-Cr-layered double hydroxide (Zn-Cr-LDH) with a mesoporous g-C3N4 lattice. Small Zn-Cr-LDH nanocrystals with a size of ∼6 nm are immobilized in the mesopores of g-C3N4. Beyond an optimal LDH/g-C3N4 molar ratio of 0.3, a further increase in the LDH content leads to the surface deposition of LDH crystals on the g-C3N4 material as well as the intercalative immobilization of LDH into its mesopores, indicating the controllability of the LDH deposition site. The Zn-Cr-LDH-g-C3N4 nanohybrids exhibit smaller surface areas than the pristine g-C3N4, confirming the intercalative stabilization of Zn-Cr-LDH nanocrystals in the mesopore of g-C3N4. The hybridization between Zn-Cr-LDH and g-C3N4 is effective in enhancing visible light absorptivity and also in depressing electron-hole recombination, which is attributable to an efficient electronic coupling between both the hybridized components. The present Zn-Cr-LDH-g-C3N4 nanohybrid exhibits promising photocatalytic activities for visible light-induced H2 production at a rate of 155.7 μmol g-1 h-1, which is much superior to that of the pristine g-C3N4 (21.7 μmol g-1 h-1). The present study underscores that the intercalative immobilization of Zn-Cr-LDH crystals in the limited space of a mesopore is quite useful in improving the visible light active photocatalyst functionality of mesoporous carbon nitride.
Photocatalytic C(sp(3))-H Activation towards alpha-methylenation of Ketones using MeOH as 1 C Source Steering Reagent	Unprecedented direct access to terminal enones via alpha-methylenation of aryl ketones to form C=C bond is achieved under visible-light conditions using methanol as one carbon source substrate and solvent as well. The reaction involves Cu@g-C3N4-catalysed in situ oxidation of methanol into formaldehyde followed by dehydrative cross aldol type reaction. Various aryl ketones react efficiently with MeOH, producing alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds only in 4-8 h at room temperature in excellent yield (84-97%). Operational simplicity, wide substrate scope, ambient reaction conditions, visible-light photocatalysis and novel application of MeOH as methylene donor substrate are the salient features making the envisaged protocol mild, efficient and green alternative to the existing methods for synthesis of such fine chemicals.
A comparative photophysical and photoelectrochemical study of undoped and 2-aminothiophene-3-carbonitrile-doped carbon nitride	Introducing molecular dopants in carbon nitride has been shown to dramatically modify its electronic structure, resulting in efficient charge separation and improved photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, we have studied the effect of doping carbon nitride with 2-aminothiophene-3-carbonitrile. A fundamental photoelectrochemical characterization has been performed comparing the behavior of the resulting material (ATCN) with undoped carbon nitride (CN). On the one hand, it is shown that the photocurrent onset shifts with the pH up to a value of 8 for both materials, as expected theoretically. On the other, ATCN, which benefits from additional light absorption, shows an improved photoactivity toward hydrogen evolution. In addition, it displays intriguing photoluminescence properties that can be additionally engineered by modulating the potential. In a more general vein, this study illustrates how to shed light on the effects of introducing molecular dopants in the CN matrix. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production over Co3O4@g-C3N4 p-n junction adhering on one-dimensional carbon fiber	Photocatalytic hydrogen production from water using photocatalysts is a desirable method to produce renewable energy. Specifically, combining multiple semiconductors to separate charges effectively is an achievable way to improve photocatalytic hydrogen production. In this study, a novel photocatalyst which tricobalt tetraoxide (Co3O4) modified graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets and at the same time their adhered to onedimensional carbon fibers (CNFs) carrier (denoted as Co3O4@g-C3N4/CNFs) was successfully prepared. The single CNFs was obtained by electrospinning technique and high temperature calcination. The g-C3N4/CNFs was fabricated through the vapor deposition method. After that, the Co3O4@g-C3N4/CNFs photocatalyst was successfully composed with the hydrothermal treatment of cobalt chloride hexahydrate and roasting technology under air condition. In addition, the photoactivity of the catalysts was evaluated by hydrogen production from photocatalytic water splitting, and the result showed that the hydrogen evolution rate was in the following order: Co3O4@g-C3N4/CNFs composite > g-C3N4/CNFs. The composite of Co3O4@g-C3N4/CNFs exhibited a hydrogen production rate of 67.17 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), while the rate for hydrogen production of g-C3N4/CNFs was 49.67 mu mol g(-1) h(-1). It was known that the Co3O4 particles which were uniformly dispersed on the surface of gC3N4/CNFs efficiently enhanced separation photo-generated electron-hole pairs, thus improving the visible-light photocatalytic activity.
Effect of graphene and carbon-nitride nanofillers on the thermal transport properties of polymer nanocomposites: A combined molecular dynamics and finite element study	Low thermal conductivity of polymers, which is one of the considerable drawbacks of commonly used composite structures, has been the focus of many researchers aiming to achieve high-performance polymer-based nanocomposites through the inclusion of highly thermally conductive fillers inside the polymer matrices. Thus, in the present study, a multiscale scheme using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics and the finite element method is developed to explore the impact of different nanosized fillers (carbon-nitride and graphene) on the effective thermal conductivity of polyethylene-based nanocomposites. We show that the thermal conductivity of amorphous polyethylene at room temperature using the reactive bond order interatomic potential is nearly 0.36±0.05W/mK. Also, the atomistic results predict that, compared to the C_{3}N and graphene nanosheets, the C_{2}N nanofilm presents a much stronger interfacial thermal conductance with polyethylene. Furthermore, the results indicate that the effective thermal conductivity values of C_{2}N-polyethylene, C_{3}N-polyethylene, and graphene-polyethylene nanocomposite, at constant volume fractions of 1%, are about 0.47, 0.56, and 0.74W/mK, respectively. In other words, the results of our models reveal that the thermal conductivity of fillers is the dominant factor that defines the effective thermal conductivity of nanocomposites.
Fabrication of g-C3N4 and a promising charcoal property towards enhanced chromium(VI) reduction and wastewater treatment under visible light	The visible light driven photoactivity of g-C3N4 can be enhanced using charcoal as a supporter. Charcoal/g-C3N4 composite materials were prepared by the simultaneous thermal condensation of melamine and charcoal. The effect of different atmospheres (O2, air, and argon) on the reaction was investigated. The effect of different weight ratios of charcoal to melamine (1:1 and 1:4 wt%) was also investigated. The physical properties of the charcoal/g-C3N4 materials were analyzed using XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, BET and FTIR techniques. It was found that an oxidation reaction of charcoal and g-C3N4 during preparation greatly affected the photoactivity. A composite of charcoal:melamine (1:4 wt%) prepared under an air atmosphere provided good photooxidation of methylene blue; whereas a composite of charcoal:melamine (1:4 wt%) prepared under an oxygen atmosphere exhibited good photoreduction of chromium (VI).
Catalytic hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol using a metal-free catalyst of porous crimped graphitic carbon nitride	Currently, most catalysts for hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol employ the size- and shape-controlled noble metal (Au, Ag, Pd and Pt, etc.) nanomaterials or which supported on appropriate supports. Nevertheless, their high prices and low reserves severely limit the industrial application. Here we report a metal-free catalyst of porous crimped graphitic carbon nitride, which is prepared by calcining dicyandiamidine (a new precursor). This catalyst possesses abundant amino groups on the terminal edges of in-planar tri-s-triazine ring and large specific surface area, thus exhibits extremely high catalytic activity for catalytic hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol in the presence of NaBH4, which can be equivalent to (or even higher than) those of the previously reported noble metal-based catalysts. Interestingly, the kinetics analysis of hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol to p-aminophenol shows that the reaction follows the zero-order kinetics, different from the pseudo-first-order kinetics for the hydrogenation over the noble metal-based catalysts. In fact during reaction process, the catalytic oxidation of BH4- and the generation of hydride ion (H-) occur on the catalyst surface, while the hydrogenation process of p-nitrophenol proceeds in the bulk solution. This work establishes a new understanding of the hydrogenation process of p-nitrophenol using the metal-free catalyst based on graphitic carbon nitride.
Aplysia californica neurons R3-R14: primary structure of the myoactive histidine-rich basic peptide and peptide I	The R3-R14 neurons of the marine mollusc Aplysia are neuroendocrine cells that express a gene encoding peptides I, II and histidine-rich basic peptide (HRBP), a myoactive peptide that excites Aplysia heart and enhances gut motility in vitro. Peptide II has been chemically characterized (35), but the complete primary structures of peptide I and HRBP have not been established by amino acid sequence analysis. HRBP, peptide I, and the prohormone (proHRBP) were therefore purified from acid extracts of Aplysia californica neural tissue using sequential gel filtration and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and chemically characterized. Amino acid sequence analysis demonstrated that HRBP was a 43-residue peptide whose sequence was: less than Glu-Val-Ala-Gln-Met-His-Val-Trp-Arg-Ala-Val-Asn-His-Asp-Arg-Asn-His-Gly- Thr-Gly - Ser-Gly-Arg-His-Gly-Arg-Phe-Leu-Ile-Arg-Asn-Arg-Tyr-Arg-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Gly- His-Leu - Ser-Asp-Ala-COOH. Compositional and sequence analyses of peptide I and proHRBP demonstrated that peptide I was a 26-residue peptide with the following sequence: NH2-Glu-Glu-Val-Phe-Asp-Asp-Thr-Asp-Val-Gly-Asp-Glu-Leu-Thr-Asn-Ala- Leu-Glu-Ser-Val-Leu-Thr-Asp-Phe-Lys-Asp-COOH. These results demonstrated that the pro-HRBP sequence predicted by nucleotide sequence analysis of a cDNA clone (24) was in fact synthesized in R3-R14 neurons. Hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity profiles of preproHRBP, combined with charge distribution profiles and predictive secondary structural analysis, showed that cleavage at dibasic sequences was strongly associated with peaks of hydrophilicity in alpha-helical regions of the preprohormone.
New porphyrin/Cu(II) porphyrin-TiO2 nanohybrids for improved photocatalytic oxidation and reduction activities	Two new porphyrins 5,10,15,20-tetra [3-((ethoxycarbonyl)propoxy)phenyl] porphyrin (H(2)Pp1), 5,10,15,20-tetra [3-((carboxyl)propoxy)phenyl] porphyrin (H(2)Pp2) and their copper porphyrins (CuPp1, CuPp2) were synthesized and characterized spectroscopically. The corresponding porphyrin/Cu(II) porphyrin-TiO2 nanohybrids (H(2)Pp1-TiO2, H(2)Pp2-TiO2, CuPp1-TiO2, CuPp2-TiO2) were then prepared and characterized. These nano-hybrids have the same anatase structure as bare TiO2 with BET specific surface area of 117.96-151.76 m(2) g(-1). There exists the heterojunction at the interface of porphyrin/Cu(II) porphyrin and TiO2 within nanoscale. The photocatalytic performances of these nanohybrids were investigated by 4-NP oxidative degradation, as well as reduction to 4-AP. These photocatalysts exhibit high photocatalytic activities compared with bare TiO2 and individual porphyrin/Cu(II) porphyrin. With CuPp2-TiO2 as photocatalyst, the 4-NP degradation can be finished within 25 min, and 4-NP is reduced to 4-AP in 6 min. The main active species are photogenerated hole, hydroxyl radical and superoxide free radical during the photodegradation of 4-NP. The possible photocatalytic Z-scheme mechanism is suggested. In this case, the photogenerated holes from VB of TiO2 and electrons from CB of H(2)Pp/CuPp are the main drive force for the high photocatalytic activity.
g-C3N4/TiO2 hybrid film on the metal surface, a cheap and efficient sunlight active photoelectrochemical anticorrosion coating	A solar light active photoelectrochemical anticorrosion paint was prepared by dispersing g-C3N4 nanomaterial in 0.05M TiO(Acac)(2) solution. The paint can form uniform film on the metal surface after paralysis, which can provide effective cathodic protection for 304 SS under visible light irradiation. UV-Vis, Powder XRD, IR and EDS characterization identified that the film was composed by g-C3N4 and amorphous TiO2; After coating the g-C3N4/TiO2 film, which has a thickness around 12 um as shown by SEM, a photo-potential up to 0.20V was observed for the metal specimen under visible light illumination (30mW/cm(2)) in 3% NaCl solution. The photo-potential can be accumulated with the irradiation time and held for many hours after removing the light illumination. Effective full-day cathodic protection for 304 SS can be provided by this g-C3N4/TiO2 coating.
A comparison of graphitic carbon nitrides synthesized from different precursors through pyrolysis	Two precursors, melamine and urea, were used to prepare graphitic carbon nitride through a thermal decomposition (pyrolysis) method. The pyrolysis was carried out at different temperatures in open air condition in a crucible with cover. The as-prepared samples were characterized by SEM, TEM, BET, XRD, XPS, FTIR and DRS. The characterization results revealed that the samples synthesized from different precursors had different physical and chemical properties. Specifically, it was found that the pyrolysis of urea yielded product with smaller crystalline domains but larger surface areas compared to that of melamine. To further qualify the as-prepared samples, the adsorption and photocatalytic activities were measured by using Rhodamine B (RhB) as target pollutant. It was found out that the precursors as well as pyrolysis temperatures had big influences on the adsorption and photocatalytic activities. Higher photocatalytic activities were achieved by samples synthesized from urea at higher temperatures. The mechanism of the degradation process was explored on the basis of the band structure and the roles of photo-generated radicals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Self-assembly method assisted synthesis of g-C3N4/ZnO heterostructure nanocomposites with enhanced photocatalytic performance	Designing heterostructure photocatalysts by simple and efficient methods has attracted increasing attention nowadays, since the heterojunction between two different semiconductors would promote the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, and improve the photocatalytic activity. In this study, the efficient g-C3N4/ZnO nanocomposite photocatalysts with outstanding separation ability of photogenerated carriers were synthesized via a facile approach of electrostatic self-assembly combined with low-temperature precipitating method. The treatment of concentrated sulphuric acid endows g-C3N4 with more negative polarity and more active sites, which serves the deposition of ZnO nanoparticles. Besides, the in-situ growth way produces a tight and perfect heterojunction for speedy electron transfer between g-C3N4 and ZnO. The g-C3N4/ZnO composite samples exhibited much ehanced photocatalytic performance than single catalysts, and the degradation efficiency of the optimal product for decomposition of methylene blue (MB) reached to 60% within 120 min, of which the total reaction rate constant was about 3.9 times higher than that of pure ZnO. The trapping experiments showed that the center dot OH radical was the major reactive oxygen species for degradation of MB, and it dropped approximate 50% of the degradation efficiency after the addition of the scavengers of center dot OH. The Z-scheme mechanism is employed to explain the electron transfer pathway, which is a main reason for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. This work provides a facile synthetic method and new sight for constructing heterojunctions for photocatalytic decompositing organic pollutants.
Influence of nitrogen vacancies on selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols on g-C3N4: A comparative DFT study	The development of new metal-free catalysts that effectively oxidise alcohols to aldehydes or ketones is one of the fundamental goals of research on environmental photocatalysis. In this study, the influence of nitrogen vacancies on the catalytic process was investigated. We performed calculations using the density functional theory (DFT) to elucidate the mechanism of selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with molecular O-2 on g-C3N4. Through modelling of the pathways of the reaction, we found that vacancy defects strongly promote the formation of aldehyde. Our results clearly depicted that there are different interaction patterns that determine the reaction energy profiles for defective and defect-free systems. Furthermore, we estimated the energy barrier for the postulated rate-limiting step for a few alcohols by using the climbing image nudge elastic band (CI-NEB) method. The obtained values agreed very well with the benzaldehyde yield reported by Ding et al. (2018) [23]. In addition to the energetic effects, the electronic properties of the nitrogen-vacancy-containing g-C3N4 were also discussed. Our results demonstrated the underlying mechanism of selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes on both the catalysts in a comprehensive and systematic manner. Thus, by knowing the individual reaction steps, further increase in the substrate conversion may be attained by modification of the catalyst structure.
A Signal-on Electrochemiluminescence Immunosensor for Detecting Alpha Fetoprotein Using Gold Nanoparticle-Graphite-Like Carbon Nitride Nanocomposite as Signal Probe	The determination of cancer biomarkers plays an important role in early cancer screening and disease diagnosis. Herein, we designed a sandwiched "signal on" electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor to alpha fetoprotein (AFP) using gold nanoparticle-modified graphite-like carbon nitride nanosheets (Au NPs@ g-C3N4 NSs) nanocomposite as the signal tag. The capture probes of primary antibodies were immobilized on the surface of the modified electrode of MSAPANI/MWCNTs/GCE with high electrical conductivity. Where MSA, PANI, MWCTs, and GCE are mercaptosuccinic acid, polyaniline and multiwalled carbon nanotubes, and glass carbon electrode, respectively. The amount of AFP was quantified by the cathodic ECL of g-C3N4 NSs from the sandwich type immunocomplex. Under the optimized conditions, the proposed sensing strategy provides a measurable AFP concentration range from 0.1 pg mL(-1) to 1 ng mL(-1) with a limit of detection of 0.03 pg mL(-1). Such protocol exhibits high sensitivity, good stability and promising potential applications in clinical analysis.
In Situ Construction of Globe-like Carbon Nitride as a Self-Cocatalyst Modified Tree-like Carbon Nitride for Drastic Improvement in Visible-Light Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution	Photogenerated carriers possess high recombination efficiency in carbon-nitrogen materials, which results in lower photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity. By reviewing the literature, it was concluded that relying only on a structure-controlled technique was insufficient to reduce the combination of photogenerated carriers without introducing a foreign material or element. Hence, bulk-like g-C3N4 [CN (B)], globe/strip-like g-C3N4 [CN (G/S)], and globe/tree-like g-C3N4 [CN (G/T)] were in situ obtained through a facile calcination method. Similar to platinum (Pt) as a cocatalyst, globe-like carbon nitride as a self-co-catalyst was found to improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers effectively. Interestingly, the hollow-tree-branch morphology of CN (G/T) effectively transmitted photogenerated holes, which thereby enhanced the photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity. The H-2 production rates of CN (G/S) and CN (G/T) were almost 10.7 and 18.3 times greater, respectively, than that of CN (B) without the addition of Pt as a cocatalyst. Notably, CN (G/S) and CN (G/T) displayed considerable rates of H-2 production in water relative to that shown by CN (B) (no activity) without the use of any sacrificial agent and by using Pt as a cocatalyst. CN (G/T) showed outstanding long-term stability, as evidenced by seven cycle tests performed over 28 h. The charge separation and transfer process of the compounds were verified by photoluminescence (PL), time-resolved PL spectroscopy, and photocurrent measurements.
One pot synthesis and characterization of Ag-ZnO/g-C3N4 photocatalyst with improved photoactivity and antibacterial properties	A multifunctional Ag-ZnO/g-C3N4 composite was hydrothermally synthesized using aqueous dispersion of g-C3N4 particles with Ag and ZnO precursors by heat treatment at 130 degrees C for 3 h. The prepared composite was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) to reveal the formation of composite metal, metal oxide, and carbon nitride. Well attached ZnO microflowers were formed on the surface of g-C3N4 sheets, when hydrothermal solution was treated without silver precursor. However, silver doped ZnO nanoflowers were appeared on g-C3N4 sheets, when the silver nitrate containing hydrothermal solution was treated. The photocatalytic activity and antibacterial properties of as-prepared composite were studied by photocatalytic reduction of methylene blue (MB) solution and destruction of Gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria, respectively. It was found that Ag-ZnO/g-C3N4 composite exhibited better photocatalytic and antibacterial activity compared to g-C3N4 and ZnO/g-C3N4 particles. A sample of Ag-ZnO/g-C3N4 also exhibited favorable stability and durability. The nanocomposite obtained from this simple and convenient facile one-pot synthesis may become a prospective photocatalyst. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Enhanced photocatalytic activity of all-solid-state g-C3N4/Au/P25 Z-scheme system for visible-light-driven H-2 evolution	We constructed an all-solid-state g-C3N4/Au/P25 Z-scheme system combining graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and P25 with Au nanoparticles, as an electron mediator, for hydrogen production under visible-light irradiation (lambda > 400 nm). The g-C3N4/Au/P25 system was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-Vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (UV -Vis DRS), photoluminescence (PL), time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), and electrochemical measurements. TEM and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) clearly reveal the morphology and structure of g-C3N4/Au/P25, implying the existence of the all-solid-state Z-scheme system. The results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and TRPL indicate that the Z-scheme system can effectively promote the electron transfer rate and the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs for the vectorial electron transfer of P25 -> 4Au -> g-C3N4. The Z-scheme system can also extend the visible light absorption wavelength from 460 to 700 nm due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of Au nanoparticles, which is confirmed by UV-Vis DRS and incident photo-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurements. The synergistic effect of the all-solid-state g-C3N4/Au/P25 Z-scheme system and the Au-induced SPR results in a highly efficient photocatalytic performance with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 259 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), which is 30 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4.

Polyaniline supported g-C3N4 quantum dots surpass benchmark Pt/C: Development of morphologically engineered g-C3N4 catalysts towards "metal-free" methanol electro-oxidation	In spite of being one of the most promising energy conversion devices, the state of the art in the efficient application of direct methanol fuel cell is far from being optimal mostly because of its heavy reliance on expensive Pt anode that suffers from easy CO poisoning. Here, in this work for the first time in literature, we have explored the catalytic efficacy and improved mass activity of morphologically engineered metal-free graphitic carbon nitride towards methanol oxidation. The 2D nano-sheets, 1D nano-rods, and OD quantum dots of graphitic carbon nitride are successfully prepared from bulk by a thermo-chemical etching process. The materials are thoroughly characterized with the help of X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, luminescence study and are studied for methanol oxidation reaction in basic condition with the help of cyclic voltammetry. Among the three different dimensional g-C3N4 materials, the quantum dots show higher methanol oxidation activity due to its abundant edges in nano morphology and maximum atomic percentages of active site of pyridinic N. The OD g-C3N4 when supported on conducting polyaniline, not only shows higher electrocatalytic methanol oxidation activity than the commercial Pt/C but also demonstrates excellent CO tolerance to be a suitable and applicable metal-free anode catalyst in direct methanol fuel cell applications. The electrostatic interaction between OD g-C3N4 and conducting polyaniline (PANI) fibres may have improved the electrical conductivity and methanol adsorption of CNQD-PANI electrocatalyst and also played a role in oxidizing the adsorbed CO to upsurge the CO tolerance.
Efficiently enhancing the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 by a simple advanced successive activation method	High activated graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was initially produced by a typical calcination of melamine, and then modified by a convenient successive activation: protonated in hydrothermal hydrochloric acid (g-C3N4-1) and subsequently immersed in aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (g-C3N4-2). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetry were used to characterise the morphology, crystal structure and thermal stability of the as-prepared samples. The SEM and TEM showed that g-C3N4-2 had a much smaller aggregate size than g-C3N4-1 and obviously displayed porous structures. The XRD patterns indicated the decrease of inter-lamellar spacing between the layers of samples and the increase of stretched properties of g-C3N4-2. Under visible-light irradiation, the modified g-C3N4 showed higher photocatalytic activity for degradation of rhodamine B solution than pristine samples due to the tiny particles aggregate and porous structure. Thus, the method of acid and alkali treatment will widen the photocatalysis and application of g-C3N4.
Strong Hollow Spherical La2NiO4 Photocatalytic Microreactor for Round-the-Clock Environmental Remediation	This work reports a moderate round-the-clock route to treating organic pollutants by utilizing a La2NiO4 hollow-sphere microreactor. A glycerol-assisted solvothermal route followed by an annealing process was applied for fabricating the catalyst. Both the physicochemical properties and the catalytic performance of the as-obtained microreactor for treating pollutants were discussed. The microreactor exhibited a strong ability to degrade phenol and anionic dyes in the absence of light irradiation, owing to its high surface area and positively charged surface. With the aid of visible-light irradiation, the degradation rate of the organic pollutants could be further accelerated due to the light multireflection in a hollow structure, which enhances the utilization of light. The present work indicates that the hollow-sphere La2NiO4 microreactor is [effectively energy saving for environmental remediation.
Merging Single-Atom-Dispersed Iron and Graphitic Carbon Nitride to a Joint Electronic System for High-Efficiency Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution	Scalable and sustainable solar hydrogen production via photocatalytic water splitting requires extremely active and stable light-harvesting semiconductors to fulfill the stringent requirements of suitable energy band position and rapid interfacial charge transfer process. Motivated by this point, increasing attention has been given to the development of photocatalysts comprising intimately interfaced photoabsorbers and cocatalysts. Herein, a simple one-step approach is reported to fabricate a high-efficiency photocatalytic system, in which single-site dispersed iron atoms are rationally integrated on the intrinsic structure of the porous crimped graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3 N4 ) polymer. A detailed analysis of the formation process shows that a stable complex is generated by spontaneously coordinating dicyandiamidine nitrate with iron ions in isopropanol, thus leading to a relatively complicated polycondensation reaction upon thermal treatment. The correlation of experimental and computational results confirms that optimized electronic structures of Fe@g-C3 N4 with an appropriate d-band position and negatively shifting Fermi level can be achieved, which effectively gains the reducibility of electrons and creates more active sites for the photocatalytic reactions. As a result, the Fe@g-C3 N4 exhibits a highlighted intramolecular synergistic effect, performing greatly enhanced solar-photon-driven activities, including excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate (3390 µmol h-1 g-1 , λ > 420 nm) and a reliable apparent quantum efficiency value of 6.89% at 420 nm.
Caldesmon has two calmodulin-binding domains	Chicken gizzard caldesmon was cleaved with chymotrypsin or CNBr, and the calmodulin-binding fragments were isolated using an affinity column. Limited chymotryptic digestion gives rise to a 38 kDa calmodulin-binding fragment (CT40) as described previously (Szpacenko, A. & Dabrowska, R., FEBS Lett. 202, 182-186, 1986; Fujii, T., Imai, M., Rosenfeld, G. C. & Bryan, J., J. Biol. Chem. 261, 16155-16160, 1987; Yazawa, M., Yagi, K. & Sobue, K., J. Biochem. 102, 1065-1073, 1987). In the case of CNBr cleavage a 37 kDa calmodulin-binding fragment (CB40) was obtained. Both CT40 and CB40 contain a reactive thiol group, but these thiols are apparently in different environments as judged by the responses of attached fluorescent labels to calmodulin-binding. A comparison of the N-terminal sequences of CB40 and CT40 with the complete sequence of caldesmon shows that the two calmodulin-binding fragments in fact originate from different parts of the parent molecule. Thus there exist two calmodulin-binding sites in caldesmon, one in the N-terminal half and the other in the C-terminal half of the molecule. This is consistent with the recent finding that up to two calmodulin molecules can be crosslinked to each caldesmon molecule (Wang, C.-L.A., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 156, 1033-1038, 1988).
Tribological Characteristics of Aqueous Graphene Oxide, Graphitic Carbon Nitride, and Their Mixed Suspensions	The tribological performance of graphene oxide (GO), graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), and their mixed (g-C3N4/GO) aqueous suspensions was investigated. The 0.06 wt% GO, 0.06 wt% g-C3N4, and 0.06 wt% 1:1 g-C3N4/GO suspensions reduced the coefficient of friction (COF) by 37, 26 and 37% and wear mark radius by 19.1, 16.0 and 19.6%, respectively, in comparison with water. Pure g-C3N4 and GO suspensions showed unstable lubrication in the tests with relatively high loads and speeds, while the g-C3N4/GO mixed suspension had superior tribological performance in all tested conditions. This is because in the mixed suspension g-C3N4 agglomerates became smaller, and GO nanosheets exhibited fewer wrinkles and less stacking, which enabled the formation of a layer of tribo-composite film. As a result, the friction, wear and tribo-corrosion were reduced during sliding.
Fabrication of dual Z-scheme MIL-53(Fe)/alpha-Bi2O3/g-C3N4 ternary composite with enhanced visible light photocatalytic performance	
Experimental design for optimization of 4-nitrophenol reduction by green synthesized CeO2/g-C3N4/Ag catalyst using response surface methodology	In this study, the enhancement of catalytic activity of ceria when modified with co-catalysts such as graphitic carbon nitride and silver was established. The material was synthesized using phytogenic combustion method, a green alternative to the traditional preparative routes. The catalyst was characterized using XRD, FTIR, SEM, EDX, XPS and TEM techniques. The synergistic effect of the composite CeO2/g-C3N4/Ag was tested for catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol in the presence of sodium borohydride. The reaction was carried out at room temperature without any light source or external stirring. The individual and combined effects of four parameters, viz., concentration of 4-NP, amount of catalyst, amount of NaBH4 and time for the reduction of reduction 4-NP were investigated using Box-Behnken design of response surface methodology (RSM). This statistical model was used to optimize the reaction conditions for maximum reduction of 4-NP. The optimum conditions for the reduction reaction are found to be 0.01 mmol/L 4-NP, 15 mg catalyst, 20 mg NaBH4 and 13.7 min time interval. (C) 2020 Chinese Society of Rare Earths.

Rearrangement of quinoxalin-2-ones when exposed to enamines generated in situ from ketones and ammonium acetate: method for the synthesis of 1-(pyrrolyl)benzimidazolones	The reaction of 3-benzoylquinoxalin-2(1H)-ones with enamines (generated in situ from ammonium acetate and the corresponding methylaryl(hetaryl)ketones) proceeds smoothly to give the corresponding substituted 1-(pyrrolyl)benzimidazolone derivatives in moderate yields through the novel rearrangement of 3-benzoylquinoxalin-2(1H)-ones involving a dual cleavage of the C3═N4 and C2-C3 bonds under mild conditions.
Zinc oxide-graphitic carbon nitride nanohybrid as an efficient electrochemical sensor and photocatalyst	In this study, zinc oxide-graphitic carbon nitride (ZnO-CN) nanohybrid has been synthesized via a facile in-situ one pot solid-state thermal decomposition method, here [Zn(hmp-H)(2)(H2O)(mu-Cl)Zn(mu-Cl)(Cl)(3)] was used as single-source molecular precursor (SSMP) for ZnO and urea was taken as a source for graphitic carbon nitride (CN). Synthesized ZnO-CN nanohybrid was used as a modifier towards the fabrication of a binder free glassy carbon electrode surface (ZnO-CN/GCE) for detection of -NO2 containing aromatic compounds. The developed sensor shows the remarkable sensitive lower detection limit responses of 100 nM, 110 nM, 202 nM towards the 4-nitrotoluene (4-NT); 2,4-dinitrotuluene (2,4-DNT); 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (2,4,6-TNP), respectively. Further, a superior and rapid photo-catalytic degradation of Chicago Sky Blue (CSB), Congo Red (CR) and Methylene Blue (MB) was also achieved by employing ZnO-CN as a photo-catalyst with the percentage degradation of similar to 85-99.6%. The alluring performance of the ZnO-CN nanohybrid towards the sensing of -NO2 containing aromatics and degradation of organic pollutants was ascribed to high surface area of as synthesized nanohybrid and heterojunction formed between the interfaces of ZnO and graphitic carbon nitride. These properties may facilitate the electron transfer process due to the higher electron conductivity and the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs.
Template-Free Synthesis of Two-Dimensional Fe/N Codoped Carbon Networks as Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction Electrocatalysts	A direct pyrolysis and template-free synthesis strategy is demonstrated to synthesize the two-dimensional (2-D) Fe/N codoped carbon networks by virtue of 2-D graphitic-carbon nitride (g-C3N4) intermediates derived from melamine. Because of the stabilization and steric hindrance of additional N ligands with bisnitrogen-containing groups (phenanthroline, phthalonitrile, and phenylenediamine), the thin graphitic-layered Fe/N codoped carbon materials have successfully inherited the 2-D morphology from the g-C3N4 intermediate after direct carbonization treatment. After the easy removal of inactive Fe particles, the resultant sample exhibits numerous well-dispersed Fe atoms embedded in the carbon layers with a hierarchical (meso- and micro-) porous structure. Owing to the high active site density and open porous structure, the thin graphitic-layered Fe/N codoped carbon electrocatalysts exhibit superior oxygen reduction reaction performance (a half-wave potential of 0.88 V and a kinetics current density of 3.8 mA cm-2), even better than the commercial Pt/C catalysts (0.85 V and 1.6 mA cm-2, respectively). The facile and effective synthesis strategy without template to build the graphene-like nanoarchitectures inherited from the 2-D intermediates will lead to a great development of 2-D carbon materials in various electrochemical applications.
Fabricating direct Z-scheme PTCDA/g-C3N4 photocatalyst based on interfacial strong interaction for efficient photooxidation of benzylamine	Constructing Z-scheme system is a promising way to fabricate efficient photocatalysts for solar light utilization. In this study, a novel all-solid direct Z-scheme photocatalyst PTCDA-C3N4 was synthesized and characterized by several methods. XRD and HRTEM confirmed the strong pi-pi interaction between PTCDA(Perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride) and g-C3N4 induced the crystal transformation of PTCDA from beta-phase to alpha-phase, self-assembling and reconstructing into nanocrystalline of 5nm. UV-vis and photoelectronic measurements illustrated that the coupling of PTCDA on g-C3N4 not only dramatically broadened visible light absorption, but also accelerated the charge transfer of g-C3N4. Both the theoretical calculation and active species trapping experiments verified the Z-scheme mechanism of PTCDA-C3N4 heterostructure, which endows the hole of PTCDA-C3N4 much strong oxidizability and effective electron-hole separation, thus eight times higher activity than that of pristine g-C3N4 for benzylamine oxidation under solar driven. Our current work paves a facile way for synthesis efficient Z-scheme photocatalysts.
Thermal annealing-induced structural reorganization in polymeric photocatalysts for enhanced hydrogen evolution	Herein, a facile reorganization of a triazine-based conjugated polymer structure was adopted to optimize the optical, electronic, and photocatalytic properties of the polymer. The optimal photocatalyst presents enhanced performance as compared to the pristine photocatalyst by a factor of 3. This demonstration provides a new strategy for the optimization of conjugated polymers for various photoredox applications.
Beta-FeOOH-supported graphitic carbon nitride as an efficient visible light photocatalyst	A novel beta iron oxyhydroxide (beta-FeOOH) supported graphitic carbon nitride hybrid was synthesized for the first time by a facile adsorption-hydrolysis method. The g-C3N4 was surface-modified with oxygen containing functional groups such as hydroxyl and carbonyl groups, by ultrasonic treatment of pristine g-C3N4 with hydrogen peroxide. Due to the formation of these groups, the beta-FeOOH was able to grow directly on the surface of g-C3N4 through strong electrostatic interactions.The as-prepared hybrid showed enhanced light absorption in the visible light region compared to pure g-C3N4, and possessed a type-II heterojunction structure. The photocatalytic properties of these hybrids were evaluated through the photocatalytic degradation of RhB under visible light irradiation. It was found that a loading quantity of 4% beta-FeOOH exhibited the best performance. The reported beta-FeOOH/g-C3N4 hybrid is a highly efficient visible light photocatalyst.

Well-organized migration of electrons for enhanced hydrogen evolution: Integration of 2D MoS 2 nanosheets with plasmonic photocatalyst by a facile ultrasonic chemical method	The construction of a plasmonic photocatalyst is an efficient way to suppress detrimental electrons-holes recombination and extend the spectral range of light absorption in semiconductors. However, the facilitation effect in the aspect of electrons-holes separation is great limited as the lack of a driving force compelled the electrons or holes migration to surface catalytic sites makes them flow randomly in semiconductors. In this work, we confirm that the integration of MoS2 nanosheets formed two dimensional (2D) layered heterojunction with C3N4 with Au-C3N4 plasmonic photocatalyst can further enhance electrons-holes separation through the formation of Au-C3N4-MoS2 nanostructure by a facile ultrasonic chemical method. The integrated MoS2 nanosheets extract the electrons not only from C3N4 due to a building up of 2D layered heterojunction but also from plasmonic Au via a "pipe" played by C3N4. The electrons "pump" role of the 2D MoS2 nanosheets makes electrons flow randomly turn into the well-organized migration direction, promoting the electrons-holes more efficient separation and lifetime prolongation. Meanwhile, MoS2 nanosheets also increase the light absorption of the photocatalyst owing to its inherent strength of the narrower band gap. Enabled by integration of 2D MoS2 nanosheets, the hydrogen production rate is 2.08 times higher than that of its counterpart Au-C3N4. This work highlights a new window to employ 2D layered heterojunction for enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.
Primary structure of human alpha 2-macroglobulin. II. Primary structure of eight CNBr fragments located in the NH2-terminal half of alpha 2-macroglobulin, accounting for 603 amino acid residues	The amino acid sequence has been determined for eight medium-sized CNBr fragments from the NH2-terminal part of human alpha 2-macroglobulin. The fragments are: CB2 (10-78), CB5 (129-223), CB6 (224-295), CB7 (296-392), CB8 (393-441), CB11 (498-584), CB12 (585-643), and CB17 (691-775). These fragments account for 603 of the 1451 residues of the subunits of alpha 2-macroglobulin.

Photo-assisted peroxymonosulfate activation via 2D/2D heterostructure of Ti3C2/g-C3N4 for degradation of diclofenac	In this paper, a two dimensional/two dimensional (2D/2D) heterostructure of Ti3C2/g-C3N4 (T/CN) was constructed and used to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for the degradation of diclofenac (DCF) in water in the presence of light illumination. Compared with single photocatalytic process by T/CN (0.040/min) and with pure g-C3N4 nanosheets in PMS system (0.071/min), 5.0 and 3.0 times enhanced activities were achieved in the T/CN-PMS system at optimum Ti3C2 (1.0 wt%) loading under light illumination (0.21/min). Moreover, the decomposing processes of DCF in T/CN-PMS system were applicable in a wide initial pH range (3-14), therefore, overcoming the limitation of pH dependence in traditional PMS system. Based on the synergistic effect of photocatalysis and PMS oxidation processes, the O-1(2) was generated as primary reactive species for the removal of DCF in T/CN-PMS system. The DCF degradation mechanism was further proposed through the results of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

A wheat flour derived hierarchical porous carbon/graphitic carbon nitride composite for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries	To buffer the volume variation of sulfur and suppress the shuttle effect of long-chain lithium polysulfides during the cycling of Li-S batteries, it is essential to simultaneously design suitable pore structures and tune the surface chemistry of carbon-based sulfur hosts. However, the associated low yield and high cost of such delicately constructed carbon materials have been the major bottleneck for their practical utilization. Herein, we present a hundred-gram fabrication of a graphitic carbon nitride@hierarchical porous carbon (g-C3N4@HPC) composite, which is derived from low-cost biomass and used as the sulfur host for Li-S batteries. On this material, interconnected and hierarchical porosity of HPC physically traps the polysulfides and buffers the volume variation, and in the meantime, the uniformly dispersed g-C3N4 nanoparticles and N dopants on it provide strong chemical affinity to further immobilize the polysulfides. Therefore, the g-C3N4@HPC/S cathode delivers a high initial capacity of 1150.1 mAh g(-1) and excellent cycling stability with a very small capacity decay of 0.024% cycle(-1) for 250 cycles, at a high sulfur loading of 64.5 wt%. Importantly, this g-C3N4@HPC composite is derived from very cheap and eco-friendly precursors, enabling the hundred-gram production at bench-top scale, which shows significant viability for practical Li-S battery application.

Construction of g-C3N4/PDI@MOF heterojunctions for the highly efficient visible light-driven degradation of pharmaceutical and phenolic micropollutants	A novel g-C3N4/PDI@MOF heterojunction was synthesized by the in situ growth of NH2-MIL-53(Fe) onto the g-C3N4/PDI layer. The heterojunction was applied as a photocatalyst for the removal of pharmaceutical and phenolic micropollutants in the present of H2O2 and visible LED light (420 < lambda < 800nm). The synergistic heterojunction displays excellent photocatalytic performance for the removal of several water-soluble and toxic organic pollutants (50 ppm) under visible light irradiation, with a maximum efficiency of up to 90% (1 h) for tetracycline (TC), 78% (2.5 h) for carbamazepine (CBZ), 100% (10 min) for bisphenol A (BPA) and 100% (30 min) for p-nitrophenol (PNP). Furthermore, the low concentration of phenolic organic pollutants (2 ppm) can also be rapidly degraded into small molecules (analyzed by HPLC) within 10 min. This performance is superior to some previously reported visible-light photocatalysts. The improved photocatalytic activity is attributed to the efficient formation of heterojunctions derived from the interface contact and electronic band structure matching between g-C3N4/PDI and NH2-MIL-53(Fe), which is beneficial to charge separation and facilitates the photodegradation process. Repeated experimental studies and structural analysis of photocatalyst before and after degradation (XRD and FT-IR) demonstrated that the photocatalyst exhibits good stability and reusability. This work provides a new insight into the construction of heterojunction photocatalysts based on FeMOF for the heterogeneous photodegradation of organic contaminants with H2O2 under visible light.
Sodium flux-assisted low-temperature high-pressure synthesis of carbon nitride with high nitrogen content	Carbon nitride powders with high nitrogen content have been synthesized via a new, high-pressure (7.7 GPa) and relatively low-temperature (400-500 degreesC) procedure that involves a chemical reaction of hexachlorobenzene (C6Cl6) and sodium azide (NaN3) in an enclosed system for 50-70 h in the presence of a sodium flux. The obtained powder product was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, infrared and electron energy loss spectroscopy. The nitrogen-carbon atomic ratio of the material was 1.24 +/- 0.15, which is consistent with C3N4 stoichiometry and represents the most nitrogen-rich carbon nitride yet prepared under high-pressure. Scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy studies revealed that the material obtained was predominantly amorphous with some fraction of nanocrystallites with the reticular distance between the lattice planes approximately 0.326 nn.

Fabrication and interfacial electron transfer of ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheet/TNT@CNTs ternary nanostructure heterojunction for high-efficiency visible-light-driven photocatalysis	The purpose of this research is to design and fabricate a novel ternary hybrid nanostructure heterojunction with high-efficiency visible-light-driven photocatalysis. The porous layered TiO2 nanotubular structures (TNTs) with high percentage of photocatalytic reactive facets, which were turned into by commercially available TiO2, were wrapped on the surface of hydroxylation carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through the formation of Ti-O=C and/or Ti-O-C bond between CNTs and TiO2. Then the TNT@CNT nanotubular composites were coated by ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets with a thickness of 3-4 nm. The ternary nanocomposites owned strong absorption performance, low charge recombination rates and high-efficiency photocatalytic activities, which were all owe to high surface areas and excellent adsorptivity of the CNTs, photocatalytic performance of TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs) and moderate band gap of g-C3N4 nanosheet. What's more, the formation of chemical bonds greatly improved visible-light photocatalytic activity with a degradation rate of 98.2 and 97.9% for methylene blue and rhodamine B in 60 min under visible-light irradiation, which showed similar to 10 times enhancement compared to pure TiO2. In addition, the existence of h(+) and center dot OH and center dot O2- radicals played main role in the photocatalytic process. The new material was of great significance to environmental protection and energy criss.
Adsorption and photocatalytic study of dye degradation over the g-C3N4/W18O49 nanocomposite	A heterogeneous nanocomposite (NC) of g-C3N4/W18O49 based on the coupling of W18O49 nanorods (NRs) with the graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) sheets has been synthesised via a solvothermal method. The as-synthesised products were characterised by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectrometry, and transmission electron microscopy. The g-C3N4/W18O49 NC exhibited very strong adsorption ability towards the methylene blue (MB) dye and demonstrated a high removal efficiency of 99.14% after 0.5 h equilibration in dark. Compared to the g-C3N4 sheets and W18O49 NRs, the g-C3N4/W18O49 NC exhibited higher removal efficiencies towards both the MB and methyl orange (MO) dyes via a combination of adsorption and degradation. The photocatalytic process of the g-C3N4/W18O49 NC followed the Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism. This work provides an efficient strategy for the synthesis of g-C3N4-based heterogeneous photocatalysts.
Ternary Ni2P/reduced graphene oxide/g-C3N4 nanotubes for visible light-driven photocatalytic H-2 production	Developing low cost co-catalysts is crucial for both fundamental research and practical application of g-C3N4. In this work, we prepared ternary Ni2P/rGO/g-C3N4 nanotubes with different Ni2P contents for visible-light-driven photocatalytic H-2 generation from triethanolamine aqueous solution. The optimal Ni2P/rGO/g-C3N4 produced H-2 at a rate of 2921.9 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), which is about 35, 16 and 9 times as large as that of g-C3N4, binary rGO/g-C3N4 and Ni2P/g-C3N4, respectively. The apparent quantum efficiency of optimal Ni2P/rGO/g-C3N4 was 5.6% at lambda = 420 nm. We believe that the improved photocatalytic performance of Ni2P/rGO/g-C3N4 originates from the synergistic effect of rGO as electron transfer medium and Ni2P as reaction site, which is supported by photoelectrochemical and photoluminescence measurements. Cyclic experiment demonstrated an excellent stability of Ni2P/rGO/g-C3N4. Moreover, we further studied the effect of other nickel-based compounds by replacing Ni2P with NiS, Ni3C, and Ni3N, respectively. The order of the H-2-generation rate is Ni2P/rGO/CNNT > NiS/rGO/CNNT > Ni3C/rGO/CNNT > Ni3N/rGO/CNNT, which could be reasonably explained based on Mott-Schottky plots. Our work reveals that Ni2P can be used as a promising cocatalyst for photocatalytic H-2 evolution. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Template-free preparation and properties of mesoporous g-C3N4/TiO2 nanocomposite photocatalyst	A novel and facile template-free method was presented to fabricate a network structured mesoporous g-C3N4/TiO2 nanocomposite with enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity. The protonation effect accompanied with TiO2 nanoparticle growth is believed to be a probable mechanism for the formation of such a porous structure of the g-C3N4 matrix.
Fabrication of Ag3VO4 decorated phosphorus and sulphur co-doped graphitic carbon nitride as a high-dispersed photocatalyst for phenol mineralization and E-coli disinfection	In this work, we have successfully anchored Ag3VO4 (AV) onto P and S co-doped g-C3N4  (PSGCN) to prepare high-dispersible AV/PSGCN photocatalyst via a deposition-precipitation method. The P and S co-doped g-C3N4  was synthesized via thermal polycondensation using hexachlorotriphosphazene (HCCP) and thiourea as precursors. AV/PSGCN was characterized using various spectral techniques. The atomic force analysis indicated that the thickness of AV/PSGCN was less than 3.0 nm. The zeta potential and Tyndall effect experiments ascertained formation of the well-dispersed suspension of AV/PSGCN in water. The co-doping resulted in lowering optical band gap of g-C3N4. The photoluminescence and electrochemical impedance analysis indicated suppression in recombination of photogenerated electron and hole pairs in AV/PSGCN. The photodegradation of phenol followed pseudo-first order kinetics. Hydroxyl radicals and holes were the two main reactive species for photodegradation of phenol. The COD, HPLC and LC-MS analyses confirmed mineralization of phenol in 6 h. Unlike conventional slurry type photo-reactors, AV/PSGCN was not magnetically agitated during photocatalytic reactions. AV/PSGCN exhibited significant antibacterial activity for E. coil disinfection. The photodegradation of phenol and bacterial disinfection occurred through hole and hydroxyl radical formation mechanism.
Preparation of Ag@AgCl/g-C3N4/TiO2 porous ceramic films with enhanced photocatalysis performance and self-cleaning effect	We report a novel method to prepare translucent and stable Ag@AgCl/g-C3N4/TiO2 ceramic films having strong photocatalytic activities and self-cleaning capabilities under light irradiation. Colloidal silica was used as an inorganic binder and P25 TiO2 was added as a hydrophilicity enhancer without which a smooth coating was not achievable. Ag@AgCl of particle size around 30 nm, was synthesized by in-situ oxidation of nano-silver particles in porous g-C3N4/TiO2 films. Optimal conditions for Ag@AgCl/g-C3N4/TiO2 preparation in terms of strongest photocatalysis were established by tests on Rhodamine B degradation under visible and full spectral irradiations. A good adhesion strength of the porous films on glass substrate was achieved. Stability and reusability of the films were assessed by cycling tests. Possible photocatalytic mechanisms are proposed based on the basis of trapping experiments. Systematic characterization of the film suggests that the in-situ oxidation is an effective and practical method to produce nanoscale Ag@AgCl.
Synthesis of vis/NIR-driven hybrid photocatalysts by electrostatic assembly of NaYF4:Yb, Tm nanocrystals on g-C3N4 nanosheets	Graphitic (g-) C3N4 is a promising visible light-driven photocatatalyst but it has a narrow absorption in the solar spectrum. To broaden its light utilization, here we present a strategy to integrate upconversion nanocrystals into g-C3N4 nanosheets by electrostatic assembly. This hybrid photocatalyst can be activated under both visible and near-infrared (NIR) lights, showing improved photocatalytic activity in the full solar spectrum. Phase, morphology and activity of this composite photocatalyst are characterized and its working mechanism is also proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Electrochemical sensor based on Na+-doped g-C3N4 for detection of phenol	In this work, a novel and enhanced electrochemical sensor based on Na+doped g-C3N4 was constructed for the detection of phenol. First, the g-C3N4 was formed through polymerizing melamine under 520 degrees C. And then the Na+-doped g-C3N4 was fabricated by a simple wet chemical method. The electrochemical sensor was constructed by modifying the carbon paper with the resulting Na+-doped g-C3N4. The morphology, chemical compositions and structure of Na+-doped g-C3N4 were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electronic microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray detector and X-ray diffraction. The Na+-doped g-C3N4 electrode was used for the cyclic voltammetry and amperometric response detection of phenol in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 9.0). Under the optimal conditions, the prepared sensor displayed good performance for the electrochemical detection of phenol with a wide linear range of 1-110 mu M, as well as low detection limit of 0.23 mu M.
Characterization of a novel glutathione S-transferase isoenzyme from mouse lung and liver having structural similarity to rat glutathione S-transferase 8-8	In mouse lung, glutathione S-transferase (GST, EC 2.5.1.18) isoenzymes belonging to the three major known classes, Alpha, Mu and Pi, have been previously characterized, along with an isoenzyme (pI 5.7) that could not be identified with the Alpha, Mu or Pi classes of GSTs. In the present studies we have demonstrated that this isoenzyme is also expressed in liver. Its structural, kinetic, and immunological properties have been determined and compared with those of the three classes of GSTs. GST 5.7 has a subunit molecular mass of 23 kDa, which is intermediate between that of the previously characterized Alpha (25 kDa) and Pi (22.5 kDa) class GST subunits of mouse lung. Comparison of peptide maps of GST 5.7 with those representative of Alpha, Mu and Pi class GST isoenzymes of mouse lung showed that it had a distinct peptide fragmentation pattern. Kinetic and immunological properties of GST 5.7 were also distinct from other mouse GST isoenzymes belonging to the Alpha, Mu or Pi classes. N-Terminal amino-acid-sequence analysis of a 6 kDa fragment generated by CNBr digestion of mouse lung GST 5.7 revealed a 15-residue sequence that was distinct from sequences of known Alpha, Mu and Pi class mouse GSTs. The sequence, however, matched with the sequence of rat GST 8-8 between amino acid residues 106 and 120 with a 73% identity. The 6 kDa and 12 kDa fragments generated by CNBr digestion of mouse liver GST 5.7 also gave sequences which matched with those of rat GST 8-8 between positions 106 and 120 and 167 and 186, with a high degree of identity. These studies suggest that mouse GST 5.7 structurally corresponds to rat GST 8-8 and belongs to the Alpha class.
A comprehensive approach to the study of collagen primary structure based on high-performance liquid chromatography	A comprehensive approach for the structural microanalysis of collagen based of collagen based on high-performance liquid chromatography (h.p.l.c.) has been developed using calf skin type I collagen as a model system. The alpha, beta and gamma components were separated, after heat denaturation, on a TSK 4000 SW gel permeation column, using a nonvolatile buffer. Monitoring at 210 nm permits the detection of 1 microgram of a single chain. The alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) chains were completely resolved using a large-pore reversed-phase column (Vydac 201 TP 4.6) eluted by an aqueous acetonitrile gradient (24-48%) containing 0.01 M heptafluorabutyric acid as an ion-pairing agent. The purified alpha 1(I) chain was digested with CNBr and the resulting fragments separated in the same chromatography system with a gradient containing a 12.8-44.8% acetonitrile gradient. The purified alpha 1(I)CB 3 peptide was further cleaved with trypsin and the resulting peptides separated first by a similar chromatography with a 4-32% acetonitrile gradient. Resolution of some poorly separated peptides was obtained by a rechromatography using trifluoroacetic acid as counterion. The isolated peptides were hydrolyzed and identified by their amino-acid composition. Sequencing of h.p.l.c.-purified alpha 1(I)CB 3 was also performed to demonstrate the suitability of the technique for the preparation of peptides for amino-acid sequencing. This study demonstrates that detailed structural analysis can be performed on 3 mg of a purified collagen.
Two-dimensional TiO2-g-C3N4 with both Ti-N and C-O bridges with excellent conductivity for synergistic photoelectrocatalytic degradation of bisphenol A	TiO2-mediated photoelectrocatalysis is emerging as a promising way to degrade refractory contaminates. Nevertheless, the concrete application of TiO2 is seriously limited because of its poor conductivity, unexpected recombination of photoinduced charges, and broad bandgap (3.2 eV). In this work, twodimensional (2D) TiO2-g-C3N4 with both Ti N and C-O bridges is successfully constructed and assembled with carbon fibers to realize efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) pollutant degradation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the generated interface heterojunction of 2D TiO2-gC3N4 can provide quick charge separation and transfer via both Ti N and C O bridges, resulting in a prepared catalyst that can facilitate the effective separation and transportation of photoinduced electron hole pairs. In addition, according to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the 2D TiO2-g-C3N4 composition with the generated interface heterojunction reduces internal resistance and becomes more conducive to electrocatalysis compared with pure TiO2 or g-C3N4. Using bisphenol A (BPA) as a typical refractory contaminate, the 2D TiO2-g-C3N4/carbon fiber electrode exhibits a higher PEC activity, with reaction rates 1.7, 2.5, and 3 times faster than that of g-C3N4, TiO2, and commercial P25, respectively. Furthermore, the greatest BPA degradation of the PEC system is much higher than the sum of the photocatalytic (PC) and electrocatalytic (EC) systems. Additionally, the enhanced activities of electrocatalysis and photocatalysis for the degradation of BPA is attributed to the collaboration of the interfacial effect and excellent electrical conductivity derived from the 2D structure of the TiO2-g-C3N4 heterojunction. This study proposes a new tactic for the design and construction of photoelectrocatalysts via a synergistic interfacial effect to improve the photocatalytic and electrocatalytic degradation activities for refractory pollutants.

Electrogenerated chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer between ZnGa2O4/g-C3N4 and gold nanoparticles/graphene and its application in the detection of thrombin	In the present work, ZnGa2O4 was incorporated with g-C3N4 nanosheets to synthesize ZnGa2O4/g-C3N4 nanocomposites through the hydrothermal method. The morphologies of nanocomposites were characterized by TEM, XRD, and spectral and electrochemical methods, respectively. The nanocomposites exhibited greatly enhanced fluorescence with the maximum emission peak red-shifted from 380 nm to 450 nm. A strong cathodic electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) signal of ZnGa2O4/g-C3N4 nanocomposites was obtained under neutral conditions, which was much stronger than those of pure materials. ECL resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET) occurred between ZnGa2O4/g-C3N4 and gold nanoparticle/graphene nanocomposites, resulting in an apparent decrease of the ECL signal. Based on this, a label-free ECL sensor for thrombin was fabricated. The sensor showed high sensitivity, wide linearity, and good selectivity for the detection of thrombin in the range from 1.37 fM to 27.4 pM with a detection limit of 0.55 fM (3 sigma). The proposed method was applied to detect thrombin in serum samples with satisfactory results. This work revealed a new role of spinel-type semiconductor oxide nanomaterials, which will provide more ECL systems for the fabrication of biosensors.
Pyrolysis preparation of poly-γ-glutamic acid derived amorphous carbon nitride for supporting Ag and γ-Fe 2 O 3 nanocomposites with catalytic and antibacterial activity	Nanocomposites composed of Ag and γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles within poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) derived amorphous carbon nitride (a-CN) films (Ag + γ-Fe2O3@a-CN) were synthesized by a one-step facile pyrolysis strategy. Transmission electron microscopy analysis shows that Ag and γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles were obtained in situ and homogeneously dispersed on the a-CN matrix. The average size of nanoparticles was 8.1 nm. The presence of γ-Fe2O3, Ag, and a-CN in the nanocomposite was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis, UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Ag + γ-Fe2O3@a-CN catalyzed the degradation of methyl orange. This catalyst was also recycled ten times by magnetic separation without any loss in efficiency. Ag + γ-Fe2O3@a-CN exhibited strong antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus. It also exhibited excellent antibacterial activity even after 20 times magnetic recycling. This indicates that this is a promising recyclable antibacterial and catalyst for environmental applications.
Fabrication of novel ternary Au/CeO2@g-C3N4 nanocomposite: kinetics and mechanism investigation of 4-nitrophenol reduction, and benzyl alcohol oxidation	Au nanoparticles supported on cerium oxide/graphitic carbon nitride (CeO2@g-C3N4) was synthesized and used as heterogeneous catalyst in redox reaction. The catalyst was characterized by different techniques such as FT-IR, XRD, FE-SEM, EDS, TEM, BET, TGA, and ICP. The as-prepared ternary nanocomposite was used as an effective catalyst for the reduction of toxic 4-nitrophenol to useful 4-aminophenol by NaBH4. The rate constant value of reduction reaction reached up to 0.106 s(-1) by Au/CeO2@g-C3N4, which was 3.8, and 8.8 times higher than that of Au@CeO2 (0.028 s(-1)), and Au@g-C3N4 (0.012 s(-1)) nanocomposites, respectively. The superior catalytic performance of as-prepared catalyst in 4-NP reduction can be attributed to synergistic effect between Au nanoparticles and CeO2@g-C3N4 support, and efficient electron transfer. The reduction reaction was carried out at different temperatures, and the energy of activation (), and thermodynamic parameters including, activation of entropy (), enthalpy (), and Gibbs free energy () were determined. Additionally, the mechanism of reaction was studied in details, and equilibrium constants of 4-NP (K (4-NP)), and () were calculated using Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. Furthermore, this nanocomposite exhibited excellent catalytic activity in oxidation of benzyl alcohol by molecular oxygen as a green oxidant. This study revealed that the ternary Au/CeO2@g-C3N4 nanocomposite is an attractive candidate for catalytic applications.[GRAPHICS].
Photocatalyst g-C3N4/GO complex material, obtained by mixing g-C3N4 and graphene oxide, dispersing by ultrasound, adding a metal salt solution to the mixed solution, stirring, hydrothermally reacting and freeze drying	
Construction of morphology-controlled nonmetal 2D/3D homojunction towards enhancing photocatalytic activity and mechanism insight	Constructing homojunction is more favorable to transfer and separation of charge carriers at the interface between structural units owing to the matching chemical and electronic structures, nevertheless it still is difficult to fabricate the morphology-controlled nonmetal homojunction. Herein, a nonmetal 2D/3D homojunction is constructed via the facile surface in-situ polymerization process, where 3D g-C3N4 (3D CC) microspheres tightly anchor on the surface of 2D g-C3N4 (2D CN) nanosheets. The obtained nonmetal 2D/3D CN/CC homojunction displays the dramatically enhanced photocatalytic performance for degrading tetracycline hydrochloride (TCHCl) compared with single 2D CN nanosheets and 3D CC microspheres, mainly attributing to the improved transfer and separation efficiency of charge carriers resulted from synergetic effect of 2D-3D structural coupling and energy band controlling. Moreover, the important degradation pathway, intermediate products and photocatalytic mechanism are investigated in detail. This work develops a feasible exemplificative strategy for fabricating new morphology-controlled nonmetal homojunction to improve photocatalytic activity.
Controlled synthesis of g-C3N4@BiPO4 core-shell nanorods via low temperature reassembled strategy	The g-C3N4@BiPO4 nanorod core-shell structure photocatalysts were prepared by a new neutral hydrothermal reaction system combined with low temperature reassembled strategy. The CN precursors were successfully reassembled on the surface of BiPO4 nanorod to form ultrathin g-C3N4 layer (about 1 nm) under low temperature. Due to the formation of the core-shell structure, it can effectively promote the separation of photogenerated charge, thereby greatly improving the photocatalytic activity under UV light irradiation. The photodegradation activity of the phenol by the g-C3N4@BiPO4 nanorod core-shell structure photocatalyst annealing at the optimized conditions exhibits 1.6 times that of pure BiPO4 nanorod. The relationship between core-shell structure and photocatalytic activity under UV light irradiation was profoundly revealed through a comprehensive contrast experiment, and the mechanism of the enhancement activity of core-shell structure photocatalyst was also explored. It was found and detailedly demonstrated that the CN precursors prepared by neutral hydrothermal reaction can be polymerized into graphite-like phase C3N4 on the surface of Bi-based photocatalytic materials via low temperature thermal catalytic reassembled method. The novel method was proved to be a universal method for construction of core-shell structures. The establishment of g-C3N4@BiPO4 core-shell structure can provide blueprints for the construction of other organic-inorganic interface electric field catalytic system and can greatly improve the attractive prospect in practical applications owing to the perfect photocatalytic performance.

In situ hydrothermal synthesis of g-C3N4/TiO2 heterojunction photocatalysts with high specific surface area for Rhodamine B degradation	Semiconductor-based photocatalysis is a promising method for degradation of environmental pollutants, but the activity of most widely used photocatalysts such as titania (TiO2) is still unsatisfactory under visible light. Herein, we synthesized a highly efficient visible-light-responsive heterojunction catalysts based on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and TiO2. The g-C3N4/TiO2 heterojunction composites with high specific surface area were prepared via in situ hydrothermal synthesis followed by calcination, using titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) and melamine as precursors. Interesting, HCl from the hydrolysis of TiCl4 served as the proton source to acidify the melamine. The g-C3N4/TiO2 heterojunction composites exhibited higher photocatalytic performance for decomposition of Rhodamine B (RhB) than pure g-C3N4 or TiO2 under visible light irradiation. The high activity can be ascribed to the high specific surface area (up to 115.6 m(2) g(-1)) of the g-C3N4/TiO2 composites and a synergistic heterojunction structure between TiO2 and g-C3N4. Moreover, the photocatalytic performances of the g-C3N4/TiO2 composites rely on the content of melamine in the synthesis precursors: with an optimum melamine content (3 g for 0.5 mL of TiCl4), the sample showed the highest photocatalytic performance, which is superior to pure TiO2 and g-C3N4 by a factor of 18.7 and 3.5, respectively. Active species trapping experiments revealed that superoxide radicals and photogenerated holes played crucial roles in the photocatalytic reactions. The results will provide new ideas for the smart design and development of g-C3N4-based highly active photocatalysts with ultrahigh specific surface area for environmental and energy applications.

High performance visible-light driven photocatalysts of Bi2MoO6-g-C3N4 with controllable solvothermal fabrication	Heterostructure Bi2MoO6-g-C3N4 composites with different pH values were prepared by a facile impregnation method. The as-prepared samples were characterized by various physicochemical techniques, such as XRD, SEM, TEM, HRTEM, UV-vis and FT-IR. The obtained samples exhibited highly photocatalytic activity toward the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) under visible light irradiation. The Bi2MoO6-g-C3N4 sample obtained at pH = 7 exhibited the best photocatalytic performance. Moreover, the prepared sample showed good stability and recyclability properties which were beneficial for its practical application. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Interfacial engineering of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)-based metal sulfide heterojunction photocatalysts for energy conversion: A review	
Preparation and Enhanced Visible-Light Photocatalytic H-2-Production Activity of Graphene/C3N4 Composites	Graphene and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) composite photocatalysts were prepared by a combined impregnation-chemical reduction strategy involving polymerization of melamine in the presence of graphene oxide (precursors) and hydrazine hydrate (reducing agent), followed by thermal treatment at 550 degrees C under flowing nitrogen. The resulting, graphene/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, UV-visible spectrophotometry, nitrogen adsorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The transient photocurrent response was measured for several on-off cycles of intermittent irradiation. The effect of graphene content on the rate of visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production was studied for a series of graphene-graphitic carbon nitride composite samples containing Pt as a cocatalyst in methanol aqueous solutions. This study shows that graphene sheets act as electronic conductive channels to efficiently separate the photogenerated charge carriers and, consequently, to enhance the visible-light photocatalytic H-2-production activity of g-C3N4. The optimal graphene content was determined to be similar to 1.0 wt %, and the corresponding H-2-production rate was 451 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), which exceeded that of pure g-C3N4 by more than 3.07 times. The proposed mechanism for the enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 modified by a 5 mall amount of graphene was further confirmed by photoluminescence spectroscopy and transient photocurrent response. The metal-free graphene/g-C3N4 composites showed high visible-light photocatalytic activity, which makes them promising nanomaterials for further applications in water treatment and dye-sensitized solar cells.
Theory and practice in diamond coated metal-cutting tools	
Fabrication of Bi2O2(OH)NO3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites for efficient CO2 photocatalytic reduction	Developing new photocatalysts to improve photocatalytic performance is of great importance for dealing with environmental crisis. In this work, disc-shaped Bi2O2(OH)NO3/g-C3N4 nanosheets (BON-CN) were successfully synthesized by one-step hydrothermal method. Among them, 20wt% BON-CN composite demonstrated much better performance for CO2 photocatalytic reduction, the CO yield on which was about 3.2 and 2 times of the pure CN and BON respectively. This improvement of photocatalytic performance is basically attributed to the formation of tightly bonded structure between the two pure catalysts, which could effectively accelerate the separation of electron-hole pairs and thereby allow more free photocatalytic carriers (e(-) and h(+)) to participate in the redox reaction process. Meanwhile, the possible mechanism was proposed based on the characterization results.
Electrochemical CO 2 Reduction to C 1 Products on Single Nickel/Cobalt/Iron-Doped Graphitic Carbon Nitride: A DFT Study	Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) is one of the most promising strategies to convert greenhouse gases to energy sources. Herein, the CRR was applied towards making C1 products (CO, HCOOH, CH3 OH, and CH4 ) on g-C3 N4 frameworks with single Ni, Co, and Fe introduction; this process was investigated by density functional theory. The structures of the electrocatalysts, CO2 adsorption configurations, and CO2 reduction mechanisms were systematically studied. Results showed that the single Ni, Co, and Fe located from the corner of the g-C3 N4 cavity to the center. Analyses of the adsorption configurations and electronic structures suggested that CO2 could be chemically adsorbed on Co-C3 N4 and Fe-C3 N4 , but physically adsorbed on Ni-C3 N4 . The H2 evolution reaction (HER), as a suppression of CRR, was investigated, and results showed that Ni-C3 N4 , Co-C3 N4 , and Fe-C3 N4 exhibited more CRR selectivity than HER. CRR proceeded via COOH and OCHO as initial protonation intermediates on Ni-C3 N4 and Co/Fe-C3 N4 , respectively, which resulted in different C1 products along quite different reaction pathways. Compared with Ni-C3 N4 and Fe-C3 N4 , Co-C3 N4 had more favorable CRR activity and selectivity for CH3 OH production with unique rate-limiting steps and lower limiting potential.
Temperature dependent photolabeling of the human angiotensin II type 1 receptor reveals insights into its conformational landscape and its activation mechanism	We present a photoaffinity labeling study of the human Angiotensin II (AngII) type 1 receptor (hAT(1)) and a constitutively active mutant (CAM) N111G hAT(1) at multiple temperatures using a p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa) containing AngII analogue (125)I-[Sar(1), Bpa(8)] AngII and the Methionine Proximity Approach (MPA). By introducing Met residues, which react selectively with Bpa, by mutagenesis in hAT(1) and its CAM, we were able to identify the position of residues that surround the Bpa moiety in the receptor-ligand complexes. Here we refined this characterization by controlling and varying (from -20 to 50 degrees C) the temperature at which the photolabeling was carried out. The hAT(1) Met mutant, as well as CAM double mutant, photolabeled receptors were digested with CNBr and the fragmentation patterns were quantified by radioactive and densitometric analysis. Many important and significant changes in the fragmentation patterns were observed as function of both the temperature of photolysis and the context of constitutive activation. The ligand-receptor complex was increasingly flexible as temperature was increased, i.e. that the Bpa moiety could more easily label increasingly distant residues. These fragmentation patterns were converted into distance constraints that were included into a simulated annealing protocol in order to explore the extent of these conformational changes. In the context of constitutive activation, the 6th transmembrane domain (TM6) was found to exhibit a relative outward movement while TM2 and 5 were found to move closer to the ligand binding site. TM3 showed a slight displacement.
1,3,5-Benzenetriyl substituted g-C3N4 for enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity	1,3,5-Benzenetriyl substituted g-C3N4 (BTCN) was prepared by copolymerizing dicyandiamide with 1,3,5-benzenetricarbonitrile, in which the bridge N-3C of g-C3N4 was substituted by the benzene moiety. A larger conjunction system thus forms between the benzene and the tri-s-triazine moieties. BTCN exhibits a narrowed band gap, obvious visible light absorption, and a promoted photogenerated charge separation. The visible light photocatalytic degradation rate of AO7 with 0.5% benzene substituted g-C3N4 is about 3.8 times higher than that with primary g-C3N4. The 0.5%BTCN exhibits excellent photostability for the cyclic photocatalytic degradation of AO7. The substitution of N-2C and N-C was also carried out by using isophthalonitrile and benzonitrile as the copolymerized precursors, respectively, which however show relatively weaker promotions to the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 than the substitution of N-3C with 1,3,5-benzenetriyl.
Soft X-ray emission spectroscopy study of characteristic bonding states and its distribution of amorphous carbon-nitride (a-CNx) films	Soft X-ray emission spectroscopy based on electron microscopy was applied to investigate bonding electron states of amorphous carbon nitride (a-CNx) films with different nitrogen contents of x. Carbon K-emission spectrum showed characteristic intensity distribution of not only sp2 bonding but also sp3 bonding. The a-CNx film with lager x, which has a larger macroscopic electric resistivity, shows a larger content of the carbon sp3: C-C bonding signal. Furthermore, the dependence of spectral intensity distribution on x suggests the presence of sp2: C-N and sp3: C-N bonding. Those results show that the relation between macroscopic electrical resistivity of a-CNx film and its nitrogen content is because of the decrease of sp2: C-C bonding and the formation of sp2: C-N and sp3: C-C and C-N bonding conformation induced by an introduction of nitrogen atoms. Spatial variation of a signal ratio of sp3/sp2 was visualized and was confirmed as a relation between sp3 boding amount and nitrogen content x.
Synthesis of Bi2Sn2O7 and enhanced photocatalytic activity of Bi2Sn2O7 hybridized with C3N4	Bi2Sn2O7 photocatalysts were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Bi2Sn2O7 photocatalysts showed highly efficient photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methylene blue under visible light irradiation. Kinetic studies using radical scavenger technologies suggested that holes were the dominant photooxidants. After hybridization with C3N4, the photocatalytic activity of Bi2Sn2O7 was obviously enhanced. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the C3N4/Bi2Sn2O7 photocatalysts could be attributed to the effective separation of the photogenerated e/h(+) pairs. The photogenerated holes on the valence band of Bi2Sn2O7 can transfer to the highest occupied molecular orbital of C3N4 via the well developed interface, causing a reduction in the probability of e/h(+) recombination; consequently, large numbers of photogenerated holes led to enhancing the photocatalytic activity.

Fabrication of Fluorescence Turn-off-on Sensor Based on g-C3N4 Quantum Dots and MgFe Layered Double Hydroxide for the Detection of Citrate	We fabricated a new and selective fluorescent sensor for the detection of citrate by employing g-C3N4 quantum dots (g-CNQDs) and MgFe layered double hydroxide (MgFe-LDH). The g-CNQDs interacted with MgFe-LDH via electrostatic interaction and the fluorescence of g-CNQDs was effectively quenched by MgFe-LDH due to inner filter effect. Upon addition of citrate, the fluorescence of the g-CNQDs was significantly enhanced, arising from the replacement of g-CNQDs by citrate because citrate competed with g-CNQDs to form more stable complexes with MgFe-LDH. Therefore, we developed a turn-off-on fluorescence assay method for the detection of citrate. This method enabled the selective detection of citrate with linear range of 0.5-3.0 mu M and 3.0-10.0 mu M with a 12.3nM limit of detection. This method exhibited advantages including easy preparation, environmentally friendly process and rapid response toward citrate.

Band gap tuning of g-C3N4 via decoration with AgCl to expedite the photocatalytic degradation and mineralization of oxalic acid	A series of functional organic-metal AgCl-decorated graphitic carbon nitride (AgCl-CNx) composites were synthesized and applied for the degradation of oxalic acid (OA) under visible light. The highest photocatalytic activity was achieved with AgCl decoration ratio of 1.0 (denoted as AgCl-CN1.0). The pseudo-first-order constant for OA degradation was 0.0722 min-1 with the mineralization efficiency of 90.80% after 60 min reaction in the photocatalytic process with AgCl-CN1.0. A variety of characterization techniques including Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectra, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra, photoluminescence, and Mott-Schottky were utilized to elucidate the physicochemical, microstructure, and optical properties contributing to the improvement of the photocatalytic performance. The results showed that AgCl-CN1.0 had an oblate flaky erythrocyte-like structure with a moderate band gap energy of ~3.00 eV. In addition, the effects of the key parameters (i.e., AgCl-CN1.0 dosage, initial OA concentration, solution pH, and presence of natural organic matter) on OA degradation were systematically investigated. Radical scavenger experiments indicated that photogenerated holes, electrons, superoxide anion radicals, and hydroxyl radicals were the dominant reactive species. Moreover, AgCl-CN1.0 exhibited excellent stability and reusability for OA degradation without detectable Ag+ release in the solution over multiple reaction cycles. The efficient OA mineralization could be mainly ascribed to the moderate specific surface area, increased numbers of active sites, and effective interfacial charge transfer of AgCl-CN1.0. Overall, the AgCl-CN1.0 composite was demonstrated to be a highly efficient, stable, and recoverable photocatalyst.
Synthesis of 3D porous MoS2/g-C3N4 heterojunction as a high efficiency photocatalyst for boosting H-2 evolution activity	A novel strategy was applied for the preparation of MoS2/graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with porous morphology. These composites demonstrate a greatly enhanced response to visible light, and remarkably enhanced hydrogen evolution performance by photocatalytic water splitting. Compared to pure g-C3N4, the bulk doping porous MoS2/g-C3N4 (BPMCN) heterojunction photocatalysts exhibit significantly enhanced H-2 evolution of 1640 mmol g(-1) h(-1) under visible light irradiation. The absorption edge is transfered from 455 nm (g-C3N4) to 532 nm (BPMCN-0.7) in the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra. Of course, structural, optical and electronic analyses demonstrate that the highly efficient activity of BPMCN is attributed to the enhanced light harvesting by efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, and the expansion of the light response range. The present work shows that the formation of 3D heterojunction should be a good strategy to design efficient photocatalysts.
One-step synthesis of few layers g-C3N4 with suitable band structure and enhanced photocatalytic activities	We report a one-step process to prepare high activity few-layers g-C3N4 by a self-exfoliated method. Two kinds of few layers materials are obtained from heating melamine (M-CN) and urea (U-CN), respectively. Although both materials exhibit similar high specific surface area, the conducive band position of M-CN ( -1.89 eV) is obviously lower than U-CN ( -1.45 eV). As a result, the M-CN sample exhibits a much higher hydrogen evolution rate than U-CN. Remarkably, the hydrogen evolution rate of M-CN is 37 higher than the bulk. Our results provide a new strategy for the preparing few-layers g-C3N4 for high photocatalytic performance.
Construction of netlike 3D Z-scheme photoelectrodes with improved photocatalytic performance based on g-C3N4 nanosheets modified TiO2 nanobelt-tubes	Netlike 3D Z-scheme graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets decorated TiO2 nanobelt-tubes (TNBTs) photoelectrodes (g-C3N4/TNBTs) were fabricated via anodization and coating technology. The network 3D photoelectrodes were characterized by HR-TEM, XPS and UV-Vis/DRS. The photoelectrochemical properties were examined to reveal the transfer and separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons. The photocatalytic activity was investigated by the photocatalytic decomposition of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) under light irradiation. Results showed that g-C3N4 with rugged surface were loaded on TNBTs by chemical bond joint to form heterostructure. The g-C3N4/TNBTs exhibited stronger visible light absorption and reduced recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs than TNBTs. The photocurrent response of g-C3N4/TNBTs was similar to 1.88-fold that of TNBTs. The photocatalytic rate of g-C3N4/TNBTs for TC was significantly higher than that of TNBTs (0.017 min(-1) vs 0.007 min(-1)). The center dot O-2 and h(+) were the dominant oxidation species during the degradation of TC. The possible photocatalytic mechanism of constructing Z-scheme heterojunction was also proposed.

One-step preparation of novel K+ and cyano-group co-doped crystalline polymeric carbon nitride with highly efficient H-2 evolution	Polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) is a helpful photocatalyst in photocatalysis field, but low carrier separation efficiency and poor crystallinity resulted its ability unsatisfactory. Herein, we developed one step thermo-polymerization method to introduce crystallinity and doped engineering into PCN system. In detail, K+ and cyano-group co-doped crystalline PCN (KC-CCN) was successfully prepared through one-step thermo-polymerization method with the precursor of thiourea and potassium thiocyanate, and showed a highly crystal structure, stronger light harvesting and significantly electron-hole separation rate. When it was used for photocatalysis hydrogen production in presence of Pt as co-catalyst, the H-2 production rate of KC-CCN presented 16.8 times more than amorphous one. Furthermore, steady photocatalytic performance and chemical structure also maintained after several recycling experiments. Evidently, this paper affords a valid and simple method for the preparation of doped engineering modified crystalline PCN.
Structural characterisation of crystalline carbon nitride thin films synthesised by electrolysis of urea-methanol solution	Polycrystalline carbon nitride thin films were deposited on Si( 400) and ITO coated glass substrates by electrolysis of methanol-urea solution under high voltage, at atmospheric pressure and at temperatures below 350 K. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR) measurements of the films deposited on Si suggested the existence of single, double and triple carbon - nitrogen bonds in the films. A maximum N/C atomic ratio of 0.81 was achieved in the films as measured by C/H/N analysis. X-ray diffraction spectra of the films grown with different urea concentrations showed various peaks for different d values, which could be assigned to different crystalline carbon nitride phases. Selected area electron diffraction patterns measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed a number of concentric sharp rings, corresponding to various planes of theoretically predicted beta-C3N4 phase. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the films indicated the existence of grains, the number density and size of which were dependent on the solute concentration. Optical transmission measurements of the films on ITO coated glass substrates revealed a band gap value of around 2.87 eV for direct transition. The hardness of the films on Si substrates was as high as 28 GPa.
Carbon vacancies improved photocatalytic hydrogen generation of g-C3N4 photocatalyst via magnesium vapor etching	Vacancies engineering was widely reported as the promising strategy for the improvement of the photocatalytic performance of semiconductor photocatalysts. In current work, carbon vacancies are constructed successfully in graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) photocatalyst via magnesium vapor etching. Experimental results show that the formed carbon vacancies in g-C3N4 photocatalyst can significantly improve the photocatalytic H-2 generation performance. XRD, FTIR, SEM/TEM, XPS and PL characterization data are employed to evidence the construction of carbon vacancies, which are revealed to be the reason for the enhancement of photocatalytic H-2 evolution. This work develops an alternative route to construct carbon vacancies in g-C3N4 materials and gives an insight into the influence of vacancies on the photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts.

Enhanced photocatalytic H-2 production over dual-cocatalyst-modified g-C3N4 heterojunctions	
Scalable 3-D Carbon Nitride Sponge as an Efficient Metal-Free Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalyst for Rechargeable Zn-Air Batteries	Rational design of efficient and durable bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is critical for rechargeable metal-air batteries. Here, we developed a facile strategy for fabricating three-dimensional phosphorus and sulfur codoped carbon nitride sponges sandwiched with carbon nanocrystals (P,S-CNS). These materials exhibited high surface area and superior ORR and OER bifunctional catalytic activities than those of Pt/C and RuO2, respectively, concerning its limiting current density and onset potential. Further, we tested the suitability and durability of P,S-CNS as the oxygen cathode for primary and rechargeable Zn-air batteries. The resulting primary Zn-air battery exhibited a high open-circuit voltage of 1.51 V, a high discharge peak power density of 198 mW cm-2, a specific capacity of 830 mA h g-1, and better durability for 210 h after mechanical recharging. An extraordinary small charge-discharge voltage polarization (∼0.80 V at 25 mA cm-2), superior reversibility, and stability exceeding prolonged charge-discharge cycles have been attained in rechargeable Zn-air batteries with a three-electrode system. The origin of the electrocatalytic activity of P,S-CNS was elucidated by density functional theory analysis for both oxygen reactions. This work stimulates an innovative prospect for the enrichment of rechargeable Zn-air battery viable for commercial applications such as armamentaria, smart electronics, and electric vehicles.
Facile fabrication of a novel visible light active g-C3N4-CoMoO4 heterojunction with largely improved photocatalytic performance	In this work, to further improve its photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4, the design of a novel and efficient photocatalytic heterojunction by doping a narrow band gap semiconductor of CoMoO4 on g-C3N(4), which was successfully realized through a simple hydrothermal synthesis - high temperature calcination method. The results of the study suggest that the mass ratio of g-C3N4/CoMoO4 (20%) heterojunction possesses much higher photocatalytic abilities than other samples under visible light for methylene blue (MB) degradation. The excellent photocatalytic performance can be due to the synergetic effect of heterojunctions which improved separation ability of photoelectrons and holes and broadened the light absorption range.

Metal Ion-Mediated Potential-Resolved Ratiometric Electrochemiluminescence Bioassay for Efficient Determination of miR-133a in Early Diagnosis of Acute Myocardial Infarction	Potential-resolved electrochemiluminescence (PRECL)-based strategies utilizing novel nanoluminophores have become a research hotspot in analytical sciences in virtue of the superior versatility, specificity, and sensitivity they offer to bioassays. In this work, novel PRECL nanoluminophore graphitic carbon nitrides (g-C3N4) functionalized by N-(aminobutyl)-N-(ethylisoluminol) (ABEI) (g-C3N4/ABEI) were developed, exhibiting two potential-resolved ECL emissions in the presence of H2O2/K2S2O8 as coreactants with the peak potentials at +1.2 and -1.6 V, respectively. It was found that He2+ could simultaneously decrease the ABEI electrochemiluminescence (ECL) intensity while increasing the intensity of g-C3N4 on the contrary. Using He2+ as the ECL signal moderator based on specific interactions between Hg2+ and thymine-thymine pairs, conjoined with the synthesized g-C3N4/ABEI/Hg2+ nanohybrids with outstanding PRECL properties as the sensing interface, a label-free and all-in-one ratiometric ECL bioassay combined with a rolling circle amplification (RCA) strategy was designed for the detection of miR-133a as a biomarker in early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The proposed bioassay provided a quantitative readout proportional to the target miR-133a concentrations in the range from 0.1 fM to 1.0 pM with a detection limit of 48.0 aM. Owing to its inherent merits for an effective amplification of the ECL signals ratio and a simple one-step assembly procedure, the proposed bioassay demonstrated excellent analytical performance with remarkable sensitivity, specificity, and low measurement deviations, manifesting its potential application in early AMI diagnosis.
Large-scale production of ultrathin carbon nitride-based photocatalysts for high-yield hydrogen evolution	Although two-dimensional graphitic carbon nitride (2D g-C3N4) and corresponding heterostructures have been widely synthesized for photocatalysis, it is still challenging to obtain 2D g-C3N4 at large-scale and also achieve high quantum efficiency. Here we report a subtractive manufacturing method mediated by Nb2O5 to massproduce high quality Nb2O5/2D g-C3N4 and pure 2D g-C3N4. Nb2O5/2D g-C3N4 and 2D g-C3N4 both show efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance, in which the optimal Nb2O5/2D g-C3N4 exhibits high external quantum efficiency (50.65 % and 14.75 % at 405 nm and 420 nm). The origin of the high efficiency can be ascribed to two aspects: (i) nanostructure engineering forming 2D structure can shorten the charge migration distance; (ii) Nb2O5/2D g-C3N4 with strong electric coupling can further accelerate the charge transfer driven by the built-in electric field formed in Type II heterostructure. This work presents a case study to realize high-yield synthesis and high catalytic performance simultaneously over g-C3N4.
Kinetics of Sulfur Removal from Tehran Vehicular Gasoline by g-C3N4/SnO2 Nanocomposite	The graphitic carbon nitride/tin oxide (g-C3N4/SnO2) nanocomposite synthesized under microwave irradiation was used for adsorptive removal of sulfur-containing dibenzothiophene (DBT) from Tehran vehicular gasoline. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and field emission scanning electron microscopy techniques determined the adsorbent characteristics, and gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector determined the DBT concentration of the samples. Application of the experimental data into the solid/fluid kinetic models indicated a chemisorption control regime that increased the removal of sulfur from the commercial samples used. A pseudo-second-order reaction with the rate constant of 0.015 (g mg(-1) min(-1)) and total conversion time of 316 min described the adsorption process. Based on the real fuel results, the adsorption capacity of the g-C3N4/SnO2 adsorbent reached 10.64 mg S g(-1) adsorbent at equilibrium conditions. This value was the highest adsorption capacity obtained so far for a commercial gasoline sample. The g-C3N4/SnO2 nanocomposite could, therefore, be introduced as an inexpensive, easily obtainable adsorbent that can significantly remove the sulfur from the vehicular gasoline fuels.
Remediation of phenanthrene contaminated soil by g-C3N4/Fe3O4 composites and its phytotoxicity evaluation	This work is a premier demonstrating the technical feasibility of remediation of PAHs-contaminated soil by g-C3N4/Fe3O4. g-C3N4/Fe3O4 has been synthesized by typical two steps involved the synthesis of g-C3N4 and the subsequent in situ co-precipitation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. g-C3N4/Fe3O4 exhibits excellent visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity for the degradation of phenanthrene in soil at circumneutral pH. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4/Fe3O4 should be attributed to the hybrid of Fe3O4 and g-C3N4 and appropriate Fe3O4 loading amount can improve not only the visible light absorption ability but also the separation of the photo-induced electron-hole pairs. The phytotoxicity evaluation, a preliminary ecological risk assess, was conducted on lettuce cultivation experiments. Base on the data of growth indexes including seeds germination percentage, root length, leaf length, and fresh weight of lettuce, it can be conclude that photocatalytic oxidation based on g-C3N4/Fe3O4 provide a mild oxidation process to degrade the phenanthrene from contaminated soil and there is no negative impact on the growth of lettuce. This work definitely demonstrates that this soil remediation method based on g-C3N4/Fe3O4 is technologically feasible and has immense potential in the application of remediation of organic pollutant contaminated soils.

MOF-templated in situ fabrication of surface-modified Ni/graphitic carbon nitride with enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution	The fabrication of noble-metal-free and low-cost photocatalysts with high efficiency has been under increasing demand for solar energy usage and conversion. In this work, a series of surface-modified Ni/graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) photocatalysts derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) were synthesized by the in situ pyrolysis of Ni-based benzenedicarboxylic acid Ni-2(BDC)(2) in the presence of graphitic carbon nitride under Ar protection. The as-prepared samples displayed highly efficient H-2 evolution under visible-light irradiation, with a maximum H-2 production rate of 2989.5 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), which was about 22.1 times higher than the value of carbon nitride (135.2 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)). This exceptionally enhanced photocatalytic activity originated from the tight bonding between the Ni-based cocatalyst and g-C3N4 as well as fast and efficient electron transfer with the help of conductive carbon loaded on the surface of the Ni species during Ni-2(BDC)(2) pyrolysis.
Multifunctional UCNPs@MnSiO3@g-C3N4 nano-platform: improved ROS generation and reduced glutathione levels for highly efficient photodynamic therapy	Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a novel technique that has been extensively employed in cancer treatment; it utilizes reactive oxygen species to kill malignant cells. However, poor performance of the photosensitizer itself, limited penetration depth and the overexpression of glutathione (GSH) in cancer cells are the major obstacles facing the actual clinical application of PDT. Inspired by the challenges mentioned above, here we propose multifunctional nanoparticles utilizing mesoporous manganese silicate (MnSiO3)coated upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) as nanocarriers for loading highly fluorescent graphiticphase carbon nitride quantum dots (g-C3N4 QDs) to simultaneously act as a photosensitive drug and imaging agent. Surface modification of the nanoparticles with polyethylene glycol (PEG) endows the samples (denoted as UMCNs-PEG) with excellent biocompatibility and long-term in vivo circulation. Taking advantage of the inherent performance of the as-synthesized nanoparticles, multimodality imaging, including upconversion luminescence (UCL), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has been achieved; this is conducive to providing effective treatment information by real-time monitoring. In vivo photodynamic therapy to achieve effective tumor inhibition was then realized without inducing significant toxicity to treated mice. As a result, this work provides a novel paradigm with highly integrated functionalities which not only exhibits excellent prospects for imaging-guided photodynamic anticancer therapy but also encourages further exploration of new types of multifunctional nanoparticles for biomedical applications.
Exfoliated Graphitic Carbon Nitride Nanosheets as Efficient Catalysts for Hydrogen Evolution Under Visible Light	Graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets are extracted, produced via simple liquid-phase exfoliation of a layered bulk material, g-C3N4. The resulting nanosheets, having approximate to 2 nm thickness and N/C atomic ratio of 1.31, show an optical bandgap of 2.65 eV. The carbon nitride nanosheets are demonstrated to exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution under visible light.
Potentiodynamic Uniform Anchoring of Platinum Nanoparticles on N-Doped Graphene with Improved Mass Activity for the Electrooxidation of Ammonia	Platinum nanoparticles anchored N-doped graphene (Pt/NG) catalysts are synthesized using a thermal annealing-potentiodynamic electrodeposition approach with melamine, graphene oxide, and PtCl62- as precursors. SEM, TEM, XRD, and XPS measurements indicate the relatively uniform and good dispersal of Pt nanoparticles on NG nanosheets. Compared to control catalysts of Pt nanoparticles loaded onto glassy carbon, undoped graphene and g-C3N4, the Pt/NG(1-1) catalyst (with a nominal mass ratio of melamine/graphene oxide of 1:1) shows the highest electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of ammonia among a series of Pt/NG catalysts. The mass activity of Pt/NG(1-1) catalyst is nearly 5.1times as high as that of Pt/glassy carbon. The excellent electrochemical performance of Pt/NG catalysts is attributed mainly to the considerable extent of pyridinic N and graphitic N-doping in the graphene network, which improves the dispersion state of Pt nanoparticles on the NG support, resulting in an apparent enhancement in mass activity.
Labelling of the cytoplasmic domains of ovine rhodopsin with hydrophilic chemical probes	The disposition of polypeptide chain of ovine rhodopsin in the photoreceptor disc membrane was investigated by using two hydrophilic reagents, 3,5-di-[125I]iodo-4-diazobenzenesulphonate [( 125I]DDISA) and [14C]succinic anhydride. Both reagents were used to modify rhodopsin in intact disc membranes under conditions where no loss of A500 occurred. Reaction of [125I]DDISA with rhodopsin approached completion after 30 min. Binding was saturated at a 75-fold molar excess of reagent, which gave binding ratios of up to 2 mol/mol of rhodopsin. Proteolysis of rhodopsin, using Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteinase, yielded two membrane-bound fragments, both of which contained bound radioactive probe. Subsequent CNBr cleavage of these fragments produced five radiolabelled peptides which corresponded to the C-terminal region and cytoplasmic loops of rhodopsin. Similar studies with [14C]-succinic anhydride also gave binding ratios of up to 2 mol/mol of rhodopsin. Sequencing of the [14C]succinylated peptides identified the location of the reactive sites as lysine residues 66, 67, 141, 245, 248, 311, 325 and 339 in the polypeptide chain. Non-permeability of both probes was demonstrated by the absence of any radioactivity associated with the intradiscal N-terminal glycopeptide. Sonication of membranes in the presence of [125I]DDISA led to the incorporation of label in this peptide.
Carbon Nitride Anchored on a Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Nanotube Surface for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction	Replacement of noble-metal-based electrocatalysts with inexpensive alternatives that have similar high performance will benefit the development of fuel cell technology. A metal-free composite of carbon nitride (CN) with nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) and its application as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction are reported for the first time in this study. The fabricated material (CN/NCNTs) formed a close interface between the two components and showed a comparable electrocatalytic activity in an alkaline medium to that of a conventional platinum-loaded carbon, superior tolerance to crossover effects, and excellent stability. The electrocatalytic efficiency of the CN/NCNT composite was nearly 100% of the four-electron (4 e-) pathway. The high performance of the current electrocatalyst was derived from its features, such as a relatively large surface area, high content of pyridinic nitrogen, and superior conductivity.
Free-standing composite films of multiple 2D nanosheets: Synergetic photothermocatalysis/photocatalysis for efficient removal of formaldehyde under ambient condition	
A polymer-metal-polymer-metal heterostructure for enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production	The tightly coupled heterostructure g-C3N4/Au/poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/Pt was successfully prepared by a self-assembling method. The heterojunction photocatalyst displayed high activity for hydrogen production from water which contains triethanolamine as an electron donor under visible light irradiation. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-visible spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) spectra analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The experimental results demonstrated that the g-C3N4/Au/P3HT/Pt structure was conducive to the efficient separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs, which can be explained by the strong junction of chemical bond between Au and P3HT. The effect of P3HT content on the activity of the photocatalysts was investigated with a series of g-C3N4/Au/P3HT heterostructure samples loaded with Pt as a cocatalyst in triethanolamine aqueous solutions. The optimal P3HT content was determined to be 0.5 wt%, and the corresponding hydrogen evolution rate was 320 mu mol h(-1).
Electronic structure of six phases of C3N4 a theoretical approach	A systematic study of the structural properties and electronic structure of six phases of C3N4 is presented. The phases under study are the beta, alpha, cubic, pseudocubic and two graphitic with different space group. The structural analysis shows that only in beta and graphitic phases the N atoms behave in a pure sp(2) configuration. In the other phases, alpha, cubic and pseudocubic, the N with its 3 C neighbors form a pyramid. The band structure for each of the six phases is presented indicating with beta, alpha and cubic phases have an indirect gap while the pseudocubic and the two graphitic phases have a direct gap. Also charge density contours are presented and analyzed.
In-Situ Synthesis of Highly Efficient Direct Z-Scheme Cu3P/g-C3N4 Heterojunction Photocatalyst for N2 Photofixation	"In this work, a highly efficient p-type Cu3P/n-type g-C3N4 heterojunction photocatalyst was synthesized in situ. XRD, UV–Vis, N2 adsorption, TEM, XPS, PL, and EIS are used to characterize the as-prepared catalysts. The results show that Cu3P nanoparticles are highly dispersed onto the g-C3N4 surface, which obviously promotes the separation rate of electrons and holes. The charge transfer between Cu3P and g-C3N4 follows the ""Z-scheme"" mechanism. The as-prepared Cu3P/g-C3N4 heterojunction photocatalyst displays the ammonium ion production rate of 7.5 mg L -1 h -1 g cat -1, which is 28.8 times higher than that of neat g-C3N4, as well as good catalytic stability. The possible reaction mechanism is proposed."
Accelerating directional charge separation via built-in interfacial electric fields originating from work-function differences	In this work, a hierarchical porous SnS2/rGO/TiO2 hollow sphere heterojunction that allows highly-efficient light utilization and shortening distance of charge transformation is rationally designed and synthesized. More importantly, an rGO interlayer is successfully embedded between the TiO2 hollow sphere shells and outermost SnS2 nanosheets. This interlayer functions as a bridge to connect the two light-harvesting semiconductors and acts as a hole injection layer in the tandem heterojunction. The induced built-in electric fields on both sides of the interface precisely regulate the spatial separation and directional migration of the photo-generated holes from the light-harvesting semiconductor to the rGO hole injection interlayer. These synergistic effects greatly prolong the lifetime of the photo-induced charge carriers. The optimized tandem heterojunction with a 2 wt% rGO loading demonstrate enhanced visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity for Rhodamine B (RhB) dye degradation (removal rate: 97.3%) and Cr(VI) reduction (removal rate: 97.09%). This work reveals a new strategy for the rational design and assembly of hollow-structured photocatalytic materials with spatially separated reduction and oxidation surfaces to achieve excellent photocatalytic performance.

Effect of Nitric Acid Activation Melamine Precursor on Structure and Visible-Light Photocatalytic Performance of g-C3N4	In order to shorten the migration pathway of e(-) and h(+) and improve the defect of recombination of photo-generated carriers in g-C3N4, this study used different molar concentrations of HNO3 to activate melamine precursor, and formed a series of x-HNO3-g-C3N4 (x=1, 2, 3, 4, 5 mol.L-1) photocatalyst by forming a protonated amino group. In order to investigate the effect of the structure of the catalyst on its photocatalytic properties, all these above obtained photocatalysts were characterized by nitrogen gas adsorption-desorption isotherms, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), photoluminescence (PL), ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflection (UV-Vis DRS), transient photocurrent spectroscopy (TCS), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), etc. The difference of visible light catalytic degradation activity of x-HNO3-g-C3N4 and g-C3N4 obtained by direct calcination of melamine was studied with the using of rhodamine B (RhB) as a simulated dye contaminant. The resuts of experimental showed that the photocatalytic activity of 3 mol-L-1-HNO3-g-C3N4 was the highest. Compared with g-C3N4 obtained by directly calcining melamine, the degradation rate of RhB increased from 38% to 99% within 60 minutes. The 3 mol.L-1-LHNO3-g-C3N4 catalyst was recycled 4 times, and the catalytic effect was still 99%. The high catalytic activity and stability of x-HNO3-g-C3N4 can be explained as follows: after activation of HNO3, the melamine precursor can make the g-C3N4 product prepared by thermal polymerization have a higher degree of polymerization, thereby a multi-layer g-C3N4 with large specific surface area was obtained. The PL results showed that the fluorescence intensity was significantly reduced, and the carrier lifetime was significantly improved. The EIS results showed that the carrier transport capacity was significantly enhanced, which improved the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4.
Nanosheet-assembled hierarchical flower-like g-C3N4 for enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity	
Enhanced charge carrier separation of manganese(II)-doped graphitic carbon nitride: formation of N-Mn bonds through redox reactions	High photogenerated charge carrier recombination restricts the photoactivity of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a promising photocatalyst. Herein, MnII doped g-C3N4, obtained through redox reactions between urea and a permanganate in an inert gas, exhibits significantly enhanced photoinduced charge carrier separation and photoactivity. This work opens a new avenue for doping of g-C3N4.

Freestanding three-dimensional core-shell nanoarrays for lithium-ion battery anodes	Structural degradation and low conductivity of transition-metal oxides lead to severe capacity fading in lithium-ion batteries. Recent efforts to solve this issue have mainly focused on using nanocomposites or hybrids by integrating nanosized metal oxides with conducting additives. Here we design specific hierarchical structures and demonstrate their use in flexible, large-area anode assemblies. Fabrication of these anodes is achieved via oxidative growth of copper oxide nanowires onto copper substrates followed by radio-frequency sputtering of carbon-nitride films, forming freestanding three-dimensional arrays with core-shell nano-architecture. Cable-like copper oxide/carbon-nitride core-shell nanostructures accommodate the volume change during lithiation-delithiation processes, the three-dimensional arrays provide abundant electroactive zones and electron/ion transport paths, and the monolithic sandwich-type configuration without additional binders or conductive agents improves energy/power densities of the whole electrode.
Photochemical identification of transmembrane segment IVS6 as the binding region of semotiadil, a new modulator for the L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel	To identify the binding domain of a new Ca2+ antagonist semotiadil on L-type Ca2+ channels from skeletal muscle, photolabeling was carried out by using an azidophenyl derivative of [3H]semotiadil. Photoincorporation was observed in several polypeptides of membrane triad preparations; the only specific photoincorporation was in the alpha1 subunit of the Ca2+ channel. After solubilization and purification, the photolabeled alpha1 subunit was subjected to proteolytic and CNBr cleavage followed by antibody mapping. Specific labeling was associated solely with the region of transmembrane segment S6 in repeat IV. Quantitative immunoprecipitation was found in the tryptic and the Lys-C/Glu-C fragments of 6.6 and 6.1 kDa, respectively. Further CNBr cleavage of the Lys-C digests produced two smaller fragments of 3.4 and 1.8 kDa that were included in the tryptic and Lys-C/Glu-C fragments. The smallest labeled fragments were: Tyr1350-Met1366 and Leu1367-Met1381 containing IVS6, a possible pore-forming region. The data suggest that semotiadil binds to a region that is overlapped with but not identical to those for phenylalkylamines, dihydropyridines and benzothiazepines. The present study also provides evidence that region IV represents an important component of a binding pocket for Ca2+ antagonists.
AgCl/Ag/g-C3N4 Hybrid Composites: Preparation, Visible Light-Driven Photocatalytic Activity and Mechanism	The ternary plasmonic AgCl/Ag/g-C3N4 photocatalysts were successfully fabricated by a modified deposition-precipitation method, through which Ag/AgCl nanoparticles (5-15 nm in size) were evenly dispersed on the surface of g-C3N4. The AgCl/Ag/g-C3N4 composites exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than Ag/AgCl and g-C3N4. The enhanced photocatalytic performance could be attributed to an efficient separation of electron-hole pairs through a Z-scheme mechanism, in which Ag nanoparticles acted as charge separation centers.
g-C3N4 quantum dots: direct synthesis, upconversion properties and photocatalytic application	Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) quantum dots (CNQDs) were prepared from bulk g-C3N4 directly by a thermal-chemical etching process. The CNQDs show strong blue emission as well as upconversion behavior, which can be used as universal energy-transfer components in visible-light-driven metal-free photocatalytic systems.

Improved reversible dehydrogenation properties of 2LiBH(4)-MgH2 composite by milling with graphitic carbon nitride	The 2LiBH(4)-MgH2 reactive hydride composite is a promising hydrogen storage system due to the combined high hydrogen capacity and relatively moderate reaction enthalpy. However, the sluggish de/rehydrogenation kinetics severely impedes its practical applications. In this study, graphitic carbon nitride (C3N4) as a metal-free additive was added to the 2LiBH(4)-MgH2 composite and examined with respect to the promoting effect on the hydrogen storage properties of the composite. Our study found that mechanically milling with small amount of C3N4 additive can eliminate the incubation period between two dehydrogenation steps and thus markedly enhance the dehydrogenation kinetics of the LiBH4-MgH2 composite. Further cyclic study found that the composite with C3N4 additive exhibits improved cyclic dehydrogenation property although it also shows capacity loss upon cycling, particularly in the second cycle. Combined dehydrogenation property, phase analysis and a series of designed experiments suggested that the C3N4 additive could react with both LiBH4 and MgH2 in heating process, and the resulting products may improve the reversible dehydrogenation property of the composite system.

Enhancement of Photoelectrocatalytic Oxidation of Cu-Cyanide Complexes and Cathodic Recovery of Cu in a Metal-Free System	In this work, a photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) system was established for oxidation of Cu-cyanide complexes and copper cathodic recovery. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) responsive to visible light and graphitic carbon felt (GCF) modified by polyaniline (PANT) were used as the anode and cathode, respectively. Addition of 1.0 mM peroxydisulfate (PS) to this PEC system efficiently increased the oxidation efficiency of the Cu-cyanide complexes from 15.56% to 81.00% at 1.5 V. In comparison with the individual GCF cathode, the copper recovery efficiency was increased from 30.07% to 58.69% using a GCF/PANI electrode; the copper deposition onto the g-C3N4 photoanode was efficiently inhibited. Thus, the total Cu removal efficiency was determined to be 82.72%. The amine and imine functional groups in PANI were favorable for Cu recovery. Based upon ESR analysis, it was proposed that SO4 center dot- radicals were generated through a Fenton-like reaction. Meanwhile, PS was also activated to generate SO4 center dot- radicals by the deposition of copper oxides onto g-C3N4 photoanode and photogenerated electrons on the cathode. The generated SO4 center dot- radicals were mainly responsible for CN- removal. The established metal-free PEC system achieved the cyanide oxidation and cathodic copper recovery efficiently.
The simple design of a new recyclable magnetic carbon graphite adsorbent based on 2-amino-5-mercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole for the fast extraction of two anti-depressant drugs	In this work, an efficient magnetic nanoadsorbent, cubic SnFe2O4/graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) modified by 2-amino-5-mercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole (AMT), was synthesized. The successful modification of the g-C3N4surface with SnFe(2)O(4)and AMT was verified by FT-IR, XRD, FE-SEM, EDX, and VSM analyses. The g-C3N4/cubic SnFe2O4-AMT composite was used as an effective nanoabsorbent for the determination of the drugs amitriptyline (ATP) and imipramine (IMP) from a blank urine sample using an ultrasound-assisted magnetic dispersive micro solid-phase extraction method. The analytes were detected using high-performance liquid chromatography. The optimal adsorption and desorption conditions were determined using the central composite experimental design method. Under the optimal conditions, limits of detection of 2.0 and 0.7 mu g L(-1)and relative standard deviation values (n= 5) of 1.6% and 6.7% were obtained for ATP and IMP, respectively, and the linear dynamic range was 2.0-6000.0 mu g L-1.
TiO2@g-C3N4 heterojunction with directional charge migration behavior for photodegradation of tetracycline antibiotics	The performance of semiconductor photocatalysts in organic contaminants degradation is strongly influenced by the structure-related charge separation behavior. Hence, titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanowire, which is efficient in directional migration of photocarriers, is prepared and employed as the carrier for the in situ growth of discrete graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) to form a compact and high-reactive heterojunction photocatalyst. The structures and properties of the samples are systematically characterized and discussed. The experimental results indicate that the tetracycline photodegradation efficiency obtained by employing TiO2@g-C3N4 as the photocatalyst is improved by 126% and 75%, respectively, compared to that using TiO2 nanowire and bulk g-C3N4. This work highlights that precisely controlling the microstructure and charge separation behavior is critical for preparing high-reactive photocatalysts. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Drawing the distinguished graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) on SnO2 nanoflake film for solar water oxidation	Tin dioxide (SnO2) nanoflakes electrodes were developed by a simple hydrothermal synthesis with a length of similar to 1.5 mm. Based on this electrode, g-C3N4 layer with an energetic band gap of about 2.7 eV was deposited by electrophoretic deposition under constant potential (30 V) for 3, 5 and 10 min, respectively. To enhance the chemical adsorption of g-C3N4 sheets on SnO2 nanoflake film, the SnO2 film was put in 0.5 M NaOH solution, and OH-ions were coated via the entire surface area of SnO2 film. As increasing the deposited time of the g-C3N4 layer to 5 min, the g-C3N4 nanosheets steadily covered the surface area. In particular, g-C3N4(5min)/SnO2 nanoflake film exhibited the maximum photocurrent density (JSC), 0.15 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs. Reversible Hydrogen Electrode under the full sun, and a slight photoresponse in the visible light of 400-450 nm contributes to the enhancement of JSC, compared to that of SnO2 nanoflake film. Furthermore, the interfacial resistance after the coating of g-C3N4 layer is sharply reduced, which is resulted from the electrocatalytic effect of g-C3N4 layer. Thus, the heterojunction developed between the core SnO2 layer showing a high conductivity and the shell g-C3N4 layer as the visible light absorbing medium can improve the photoelectrochemical performance (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Oxygen-functionalized g-C3N4 layers anchored with Ni(OH)(2) nanoparticles assembled onto Ni foam as binder-free outstanding electrode for supercapacitors	In this paper, a facile co-electrophoretic/electrodeposition method is reported to simple embedding a binder-free composite of porous oxygen-functionalized graphitic carbon nitride (O@g-C3N4)/nickel hydroxide nanoparticles (Ni(OH)(2) NPs) into porous nickel-foam (NF) support. The prepared samples are analyzed using FT-IR, Raman, XRD, TGA/DSC, FE-SEM and TEM techniques. The analyses results proved formation of mixed alpha/beta-Ni(OH)(2) NPs onto the surface of O@g-C3N4 layers electrophoretically embedded onto NF support. The electrochemical charge storing ability of the fabricated O@g-C3N4/Ni(OH)(2)/NF electrode was evaluated in KOH electrolyte, and its specific capacity value was calculated to be as high as 967 C g(-1), which was higher than those of pristine Ni (OH)(2)/NF and O@g-C3N4/NF electrodes (i.e. 754.8 C g(-1) and 287 C g(-1), respectively). Furthermore, O@g-C3N4/Ni(OH)(2)/NF exhibited an outstanding cycling stability of 94.4% after 5000 cycles at 3 A g(-1), which was higher than the long-term stability delivered by Ni(OH)(2)/NF electrode (i.e. 77.5% at 3 A g(-1)). EIS data revealed that the fabricated O@g-C3N4/Ni(OH)(2)/NF hybrid electrode had lower internal resistance and smaller charge transfer resistance confirming its higher charge transfer rate and better electrical conductivity in comparison to pristine Ni(OH)(2)/NF electrode.
Monitoring the insertion of Pt into Cu2-xSe nanocrystals: a combined structural and chemical approach for the analysis of new ternary phases	The tuning of the chemical composition in nanostructures is a key aspect to control for the preparation of new multifunctional and highly performing materials. The modification of Cu2-xSe nanocrystals with Pt could provide a good way to tune both optical and catalytic properties of the structure. Although the heterogeneous nucleation of metallic Pt domains on semiconductor chalcogenides has been frequently reported, the insertion of Pt into chalcogenide materials has not been conceived so far. In this work we have explored the experimental conditions to facilitate and enhance the insertion of Pt into the Cu2-xSe nanocrystalline lattice, forming novel ternary phases that show a high degree of miscibility and compositional variability. Our results show that Pt is mainly found as a pure metal or a CuPt alloy at high Pt loads (Pt : Cu atomic ratio in reaction medium >1). However, two main ternary CuPtSe phases with cubic and monoclinic symmetry can be identified when working at lower Pt : Cu atomic ratios. Their structure and chemical composition have been studied by local STEM-EDS and HRTEM analyses. The samples containing ternary domains have been loaded on graphite-like C3N4(g-C3N4) semiconductor layers, and the resulting nanocomposite materials have been tested as promising photocatalysts for the production of H(2)from aqueous ethanolic solutions.

2nd international workshop on graphene and C3N4-based photocatalysts Preface	
Salt-Assisted Synthesis of 3D Porous g-C3N4 as a Bifunctional Photo and Electrocatalyst	Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), characterized with a suitable bandgap, has aroused great interest as a robust and efficient catalyst for solar energy utilization. Herein, we introduce a new strategy to fabricate a three-dimensional (3D) porous g-C3N4 by a facile NaCl-assisted ball-milling strategy. The porous structure induced advantages, such as a higher specific surface area, more efficient charge separation, and faster electron-transfer efficiency, enable the 3D porous g-C3N4 to achieve impressive properties as a bifunctional catalyst for both photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As a result, the 3D porous g-C3N4 exhibits a hydrogen evolution rate of 598 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) with an apparent quantum yield of 3.31% at 420 nm for photocatalytic H-2 generation, which is much higher than that of the bulk g-C3N4. Simultaneously, the porous g-C3N4 also presents an attractive OER performance with a low onset potential of 1.47 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) in an alkaline electrolyte after rational cobalt-doping. Accordingly, the NaCl-assisted ball-milling strategy paves the way to the rational design of a controllable porous structure.
Porous Graphitic Carbon Nitride Synthesized via Using Carbon Nanotube as a Novel Recyclable Hard Template for Efficient Visible Light Photocatalytic Organic Pollutant Degradation	Two-dimensional (2D) graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has attracted considerable attention due to its many intriguing properties in visible light photocatalysis. However, the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 is far from satisfaction partly because standard synthesis methods prepare rather dense materials with low specific surface area. Herein, we report a facile approach to prepare porous g-C3N4 via using carbon nanotubes (CNT) as a novel hard template for the first time. Unlike other hard templates, CNT can be easily removed by ultrasonic method and recycled to produce porous g-C3N4. The as-prepared porous g-C3N4 has a much higher specific surface area of 103.3 m(2) g(-1) than the bulk g-C3N4 of 10.5 m(2) g(-1). The photocatalytic organic pollutant decomposition rate of porous g-C3N4 is nearly 4.4 times as high as that of bulk g-C3N4 under visible light (lambda > 400 nm) irradiation. This work opens a new way to explore the sustainable, environment-friendly preparation of high-performance g-C3N4 for solar energy conversion and environmental remediation, especially for large-scale applications in industry.
Mechanochemical synthesis of nanostructured metal nitrides, carbonitrides and carbon nitride: a combined theoretical and experimental study	Nowadays, the development of highly efficient routes for the low cost synthesis of nitrides is greatly growing. Mechanochemical synthesis is one of those promising techniques which is conventionally employed for the synthesis of nitrides by long term milling of metallic elements under a pressurized N2 or NH3 atmosphere (A. Calka and J. I. Nikolov, Nanostruct. Mater., 1995, 6, 409-412). In the present study, we describe a versatile, room-temperature and low-cost mechanochemical process for the synthesis of nanostructured metal nitrides (MNs), carbonitrides (MCNs) and carbon nitride (CNx). Based on this technique, melamine as a solid nitrogen-containing organic compound (SNCOC) is ball milled with four different metal powders (Al, Ti, Cr and V) to produce nanostructured AlN, TiCxN1-x, CrCxN1-x, and VCxN1-x (x ∼ 0.05). Both theoretical and experimental techniques are implemented to determine the reaction intermediates, products, by-products and finally, the mechanism underling this synthetic route. According to the results, melamine is polymerized in the presence of metallic elements at intermediate stages of the milling process, leading to the formation of a carbon nitride network. The CNx phase subsequently reacts with the metallic precursors to form MN, MCN or even MCN-CNx nano-composites depending on the defect formation energy and thermodynamic stability of the corresponding metal nitride, carbide and C/N co-doped structures.
Wear-resistant thin films of amorphous carbon nitride prepared by shielded arc ion plating	Amorphous carbon nitride (a-C:N) thin films were synthesized by means of shielded are ion plating using a graphite target and pure nitrogen gas. The mechanical properties and chemical structures of these a-C:N films were studied through nanoindentation and X-ray photoelectron Spectroscopic analysis. Nanohardness of the a-C:N film prepared at a substrate bias voltage of 0 V was approximate to 10 GPa. It was increased to 13-14 GPa when the substrate was biased negatively in the range of - 100 to - 500 V. The a-C:N film prepared at a bias of -300 V was particularly wear-resistant such that the film did not wear at all when rubbed with a diamond tip at a contact force of 20 mu N. This highly wear-resistant a-C:N film was found to contain almost equal amounts of two C-N phases: beta-C3N4-like and graphitelike phases.
Graphitic Carbon Nitride Decorated with Cu2O Nanoparticles for the Visible Light Activated Synthesis of Ynones, Aminoindolizines, and Pyrrolo [1, 2-a] Quinoline	Copper nanoparticles supported on graphitic carbon nitride (Cu2O NPs@ g-C3N4) make a photoactive catalyst that has been developed for the preparation of ynone, aminoindolizines, and pyrrolo [1, 2-a] quinoline in mild and sustainable conditions. The catalyst is well characterized by various analytical techniques. The reaction can be completed using visible light more smoothly without the requirement of any other external sources of energy. The Cu2O NPs@ gC3N4 material is found to be a more efficient, active, and reusable catalyst for the synthesis of ynone, aminoindolizines, and pyrrolo [1, 2-a] quinoline. Green chemistry metrics such as atom economy (AE) and E-factor are calculated for the reaction, and it is found that the present protocol is more facile and follows the green chemistry principles.
A novel ternary magnetic Fe 3 O 4/g-C3N4/Carbon layer composite for efficient removal of Cr (VI): A combined approach using both batch experiments and theoretical calculation	Heavy metal pollution has posed a potential hazard to the ecological environment and human health. Herein, a novel ternary magnetic adsorbent (Fe3O4/g-C3N4/Carbon layer, Carbon layer: hydrothermal products from sucrose) was synthesized through a simple hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) method for removal of hexavalent chromium (Cr (VI)) removal. The Carbon layer (CL) formed during the HTC of carbon precursors (sucrose) acted as a reducing agent. Also, it has abundant oxygen-containing groups on its surface. The Fe3O4/g-C3N4/CL had a high removal capacity for Cr (VI) (50.09 mg/g), and excellent regeneration and magnetic separation performance. Importantly, the Fe3O4/g-C3N4/CL could not only improve the adsorption ability for Cr (VI), but also strengthen the immobilization of Cr (III). Based on the comprehensive experiments and characterization, combined with DFT calculations, we proposed that, the first time, the removal of Cr (VI) was controlled by three consecutive processes: (1) ion exchange of Cr (VI) by hydroxyl groups, (2) reduction of Cr (VI) to Cr (III) by electron-donor (oxygen-containing) groups (EDGs), and (3) complexation of Cr (III) by amine groups. This study provides a new avenue for the removal of toxic oxygen anions and reveals an original removal mechanism of Fe3O4/g-C3N4/CLx (x = hydrothermal products from carbon precursors (glucose, ascorbic acid, cellulose)).
Graphitic carbon nitride/alpha-Fe2O3 heterostructures for sensitive photoelectrochemical non-enzymatic glucose sensor	Glucose is one of the major energy sources in organisms, which also is an important biomarker in clinic diabetes diagnosis. Owing to urgent requirements in clinic diabetes diagnosis, developing glucose detection method with accuracy, sensitivity and stability becomes urgently important. A sensitively and stably photoelectrochemical (PEC) non-enzymatic glucose sensor was constructed using the graphitic carbon nitride/alpha-Fe2O3 (g-CN/alpha-Fe2O3) heterojunction. The g-CN/alpha-Fe2O3 heterojunction was synthesized using a facile hydrothermal process in the presence of ionic liquids. The alpha-Fe2O3 nanoparticles anchored to the surface of g-CN, which contributed to forming formation the heterojunction between alpha-Fe2O3 and g-CN. The heterojunction can accelerate the migration of photogenerated carriers, resulting in enhanced PEC performance. As a result, the g-CN/alpha-Fe2O3 heterojunction achieved the enhancing photocurrent density compared to alpha-Fe2O3 alone. In addition, the introduction of glucose can boost electron-hole separation, resulting in sensitive PEC tracing of glucose level in aqueous solution. The sensor can trace the contents of glucose among 0.1 to 11.5 mg L-1 with an acceptable stability. Furthermore, the detection limit of the PEC non-enzymatic glucose sensor is significantly lowered to 0.03 mg L-1. It means the PEC non-enzymatic glucose sensor constructed by the g-CN/alpha-Fe2O3 heterojunction can be a promising platform to detect glucose.
One-pot hydrothermal synthesis of g-C3N4/Ag/AgCl/BiVO4 micro-flower composite for the visible light degradation of ibuprofen	A novel visible-light-driven g-C3N4/Ag/AgCl/BiVO4 micro-flower composite was synthesized by a simple onepot hydrothermal method. Morphological and structural studies of the composite showed the formation of microsheets of different sizes (280-450 nm) and (1 2 1)/(0 4 0) as the preferential planes. Optical absorption examination of g-C3N4/Ag/AgCl/BiVO4 revealed its small band gap (E-g = 2.4 eV), which enables it to absorb light in the visible light region. The photocatalytic activity of the g-C3N4/Ag/AgCl/BiVO(4 )was determined by the photocatalytic degradation of ibuprofen (IBU) under visible light irradiation. Compared to BiVO4, Ag/AgCl/BiVO4 and g-C3N4/BiVO4, the g-C3N4/Ag/AgCl/BiVO4 showed remarkable efficiency by degrading 94.7% of IBU in 1 h at a photocatalyst dosage of 0.25 g/L. Furthermore, the photocatalytic degradation performance of g-C3N4/Ag/AgCl/BiVO4 increased when the intensity of the (1 2 1)/(0 4 0) planes increased. Under dark conditions, insignificant adsorption of IBU was observed on the surface of g-C3N4/Ag/AgCl/BiVO4 due to its low surface area (3.67 m(2) g(-1)). The excellent photocatalytic activity is likely due to visible light absorption and increased lifetime of photogenerated electron-hole pairs along the heterojunction. The kinetics of the IBU photodegradation was found to follow the pseudo-first-order reaction. The influence of the key parameters during synthesis (i.e., pH, amount of g-C3N4, amount of AgNO3, photodeposition time, and autoclaving time) on the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4/Ag/AgCl/BiVO4 was also investigated. It was found that the Ag content and pH are the most crucial parameters in the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. The g-C3N4/Ag/AgCl/BiVO4 produced 4.8 mu mol of CO2 showing its mineralization and the remaining intermediates were confirmed by LCMS.
HKUST-1 Derived Hollow C-Cu2-xS Nanotube/g-C3N4 Composites for Visible-Light CO2 Photoreduction with H2O Vapor	As the main component of syngas, reducing CO2 to CO with high selectivity through photocatalysis could provide a sustainable way to alleviate energy shortage issues. Developing a photocatalytic system with low cost and high performance that is environmentally friendly is the ultimate goal towards CO2 photoreduction. Herein, an efficient and economic three-component heterojunction photocatalyst is designed and fabricated for converting CO2 to CO in the absence of organic sacrificial agents. The heterojunction is made of Cu2-xS nanotubes coated with a carbon layer (C-Cu2-xS) and g-C3N4. By using the classical MOF material HKUST-1 as a precursor, hollow tubular-like metal sulfides (C-Cu2-xS) with carbon coating were synthesized and further loaded on g-C3N4, forming a three-component heterojunction C-Cu2-xS@g-C3N4. The carbon coat in C-Cu2-xS@g-C3N4 acts as an electron reservoir, which facilitates electron-hole pair separation. The optimized C-Cu2-xS@g-C3N4 acted as a photocatalyst in CO2 reduction with a high reactivity of 1062.6 mu mol g(-1) and selectivity of 97 %. Compared with bare g-C3N4 (158.4 mu mol g(-1)) and C-Cu2-xS, the reactivity is nearly 7 and 23-fold enhanced and this CO generation rate is higher than most of the reported Cu2S or g-C3N4 composites under similar conditions. The prominent activity may result from enhanced light adsorption and effective charge separation. This work might open up an alternative method for the design and fabrication of high-performance and low-cost photocatalysts for efficiently and durably converting CO2 to CO with high selectivity.
Gas-sculpted g-C3N4 for efficient photocatalytic reduction of U(VI)	Photocatalytic reduction of soluble U(VI) into insoluble U(IV) with g-C3N4 is considered to be an effective strategy to remove uranium from waste water. However, the traditional g-C3N4 suffers from the defects of low specific surface area and serious recombination rate of photo-induced electrons and holes. In this work, a sample strategy of synthesize porous g-C3N4 was obtained by sculpturing with HCl which was derived from NH4Cl. Furthermore, with the method of gas-sculpturing exhibit higher photocatalytic performance, which is 4.8 times higher than that of bulk g-C3N4. The method of gas-sculpturing suggests a new and promising candidate for constructing effective photocatalysts.
A facile hydrothermal synthesis of carbon dots modified g-C3N4 for enhanced photocatalytic H-2-evolution performance	Carbon dots (CDs)/g-C3N4 is a promising photocatalyst to split water for H-2 production; however, the synthesis of CDs/g-C3N4 is usually rigorous and involves multiple steps, which limits its practical application. In this study, a facile hydrothermal approach was developed to prepare CDs/g-C3N4 photocatalysts using L-ascorbic acid and g-C3N4 as the precursors. Upon in situ thermal polymerization of L-ascorbic acid on the g-C3N4 surface, the carbon dots were homogeneously and solidly modified on the g-C3N4 surface. The CDs/g-C3N4 photocatalysts showed higher photocatalytic performance for H-2 production than g-C3N4 under UV light irradiation using lactic acid as the sacrificial agent. The improved photocatalytic performance of CDs/g-C3N4 was mainly attributed to rapid interfacial charge transfer. After a Pt co-catalyst was loaded, the Pt-CDs/g-C3N4 catalyst formed exhibited a further improved photocatalytic performance for H-2 production and could even split pure water to produce H-2. Considering our present economic and facile synthetic approach for the modification of carbon dots on the surface of g-C3N4 photocatalysts, the as-prepared CDs/g-C3N4 photocatalysts will be promising for practical use in water splitting.
Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer from Water to a Model Heptazine-Based Molecular Photocatalyst	To gain mechanistic understanding of heptazine-based photochemistry, we synthesized and studied 2,5,8-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,4,6,7,9,9b-heptaazaphenalene (TAHz), a model molecular photocatalyst chemically related to carbon nitride. On the basis of time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) spectroscopy, we kinetically reveal a new feature that emerges in aqueous dispersions of TAHz. Using global target analysis, we spectrally and kinetically resolve the new emission feature to be blue shifted from the steady-state luminescence, and observe a fast decay component exhibiting a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of 2.9 in H2O versus D2O, not observed in the steady-state PL. From ab initio electronic-structure calculations, we attribute this new PL peak to the fluorescence of an upper excited state of mixed nπ*/ππ* character. In water, the KIE suggests the excited state is quenched by proton-coupled electron transfer, liberating hydroxyl radicals that we detect using terephthalic acid. Our findings are consistent with recent theoretical predictions that heptazine-based photocatalysts can participate in proton-coupled electron transfer with H2O.
Supramolecular Copolymerization Strategy for Realizing the Broadband White Light Luminescence Based on N-Deficient Porous Graphitic Carbon Nitride (g-C3N4)	The N-deficient porous g-C3N4 with broadband white light emission was constructed by supramolecular copolymerization design, which combined organic copolymers cyanuric acid and 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine with melamine upon the mixture gas environment of (95%)N2/(5%)H2. Herein, we achieved great breakthrough in narrowing the band gap of g-C3N4 from 2.64 to 1.39 eV. Furthermore, in contrast to pristine g-C3N4, we demonstrated that the emission wavelengths of N-deficient porous g-C3N4 can be tuned from narrow blue to broadband white range, where the optimal white light coordinate position is (0.297, 0.345). The prepared N-deficient porous g-C3N4 overcomes the limitation of the narrow adjusting range of optical properties while using conventional g-C3N4 and makes it more promising for applications in solid-state displays.
In Situ Preparation of Ru@N-Doped Carbon Catalyst for the Hydrogenolysis of Lignin To Produce Aromatic Monomers	A high-performance catalyst is the key to selectively convert lignin into aromatic monomers. In this study, Ru@N-doped carbon catalysts were prepared in situ by a two-stage pyrolysis of a mixture of d-glucosamine hydrochloride (GAH) and ruthenium trichloride with melamine acting as a soft template. The layered graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and the well-wrinkled, mesoporous graphitic carbon with doped nitrogen atoms were formed after the pyrolysis at 600 and 800 degrees C, respectively. For the latter catalyst, the incorporation of either pyridinic or pyrrolic N atoms on the graphitic carbon support could not only homogeneously disperse and stabilize the Ru nanoparticles (NPs) but also create the defect-rich carbon structure. Compared with commercial Pd/C and Ru/C catalysts, the Ru@N-doped carbon catalyst contributed to higher catalytic activity for lignin depolymerization. The yield of the aromatic monomers reached similar to 30.5% over the optimal catalyst at 300 degrees C.
Bimetallic ZIF derived Co nanoparticle anchored N-doped porous carbons for an efficient oxygen reduction reaction	Five isostructural, new bimetallic ZIF precursors with various Zn/Co ratios were successfully synthesized to derive a series of N-doped porous carbons embedded with Co nanoparticles. We systematically investigated the effect of different bimetal ratios in ZIF precursors on the electrocatalytic properties of the obtained porous carbon catalysts. The optimised material Zn2Co1-NPs@NC sample demonstrated excellent oxygen reduction reaction performance with a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.849 V, superior to that of commercial Pt/C, and the electron transfer number was 3.98 at 0.2 V to 0.5 V, exhibiting a nearly four-electron selectivity. Furthermore, by exploring the current-time chronoamperometric response over 40 000 s, it is shown that the long-term stability of Zn2Co1-NPs@NC was much better than that of the commercial Pt/C.
Porous graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets for photocatalytic degradation of formaldehyde gas	In this work, the porous g-C3N4 nanosheet with enhanced photocatalytic performance can be easily obtained using a "two step" strategy by treating melamine with organic acids and aldehydes. The photocatalytic performance of the samples was evaluated by the formation of carbon dioxide from formaldehyde under LED lamp irradiation. The photocatalytic activity of porous g-C3N4 nanosheet was improved significantly which the possible mechanism is that formaldehyde molecules are more easily adsorbed around the hole. This behavior reduces the carrier diffusion distance and increases the probability of photocatalytic reaction. The photocatalytic activity provides many reactive sites for formaldehyde.
Accelerated Bone Regeneration by Two-Photon Photoactivated Carbon Nitride Nanosheets	Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) present promising opportunities for therapeutic medicine. Carbon derivatives showed only marginal enhancement in stem cell differentiation toward bone formation. Here we report that red-light absorbing carbon nitride (C3N4) sheets lead to remarkable proliferation and osteogenic differentiation by runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) activation, a key transcription factor associated with osteoblast differentiation. Accordingly, highly effective hBMSCs-driven mice bone regeneration under red light is achieved (91% recovery after 4 weeks compared to 36% recovery in the standard control group in phosphate-buffered saline without red light). This fast bone regeneration is attributed to the deep penetration strength of red light into cellular membranes via tissue and the resulting efficient cell stimulation by enhanced photocurrent upon two-photon excitation of C3N4 sheets near cells. Given that the photoinduced charge transfer can increase cytosolic Ca2+ accumulation, this increase would promote nucleotide synthesis and cellular proliferation/differentiation. The cell stimulation enhances hBMSC differentiation toward bone formation, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of near-infrared two-photon absorption of C3N4 sheets in bone regeneration and fracture healing.
Hierarchical magnetic petal-like Fe3O4-ZnO@g-C3N4 for removal of sulfamethoxazole, suppression of photocorrosion, by-products identification and toxicity assessment	Herein, a petal-like photocatalyst, Fe3O4-ZnO@g-C3N4 (FZG) with different g-C3N4 to ZnO ratios was synthesized with hierarchical structure. The FZG1 photocatalyst, having the weight ratio of 1:1 for the initial urea and Fe3O4-ZnO (Fe-ZnO), presented the highest sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation rate of 0.0351 (min(-1)), which was 2.6 times higher than that of pristine ZnO. Besides the facile separation, the performance of photocatalyst was improved due to the function of iron oxide as an electron acceptor that reduced the electron/hole recombination rate. The coating of g-C3N4 on the Fe-ZnO surface not only acted as a protective layer for ZnO against photocorrosion, but it also enhanced the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst for SMX degradation through the heterojunction mechanism. By using the FZG1 photocatalyst, 95% SMX removal was obtained after 90 min reaction, while 47% COD and 30% TOC removal were achieved after 60 min treatment under a low energy-consuming UV lamp (10 W). Moreover, a substantial reduction in the solution toxicity was shown after the treatment, as compared with the SMX solution before treatment. The LC-HR-MS/MS analysis results showed that the concentration of most detected by-products produced after 90 min reaction by FZG1 was considerably lower than those obtained using other synthesized photocatalysts. By performing radical scavenging experiments, OH' radical was found to be the major reactive species. The FZG1 photocatalyst also displayed excellent reusability in five cycles and the leaching of zinc and iron ions was reduced by 54% and -100%, respectively, after coating Fe-ZnO with g-C3N4.

Two-phase nanostructured carbon nitride films prepared by direct current magnetron sputtering and thermal annealing	Two-phase nanocrystalline/amorphous carbon nitride films have been successfully prepared by direct current magnetron sputtering and the following thermal annealing at 1000 K. The analysis of Raman spectra supports the existence of sp(3)-hybridized C-N bonds in the films. The results obtained from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicate that the fractional concentration of the tetrahedral bonded crystalline phase in the carbon nitride films is 40%, and the ratio of N:C in the tetrahedral bonded crystalline phase is 1.12:1. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations indicate that the films contain a very dense and homogenous distribution of nanocrystalline grains, and the lattice parameters of these crystalline phases are in good agreement with the theoretically predicted beta-C3N4 lattice constant. The films deposited on Si substrates have a high hardness of 40 GPa, and the correlations between the microstructure of the films and their mechanical properties are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Pressure tuned photoluminescence and band gap in two-dimensional layered g-C3N4: the effect of interlayer interactions	We show that the photoluminescence (PL) emission color of few layered g-C3N4 (FL-CN) can be tuned from blue to yellow by applying pressure. FL-CN also exhibits an anomalous PL enhancement and obvious change in the light absorption at very low pressure. Further studies reveal that the increase of pressure-induced interlayer interactions affects the charge separation of photo-induced electrons and holes and thus leads to PL enhancement. An obvious decrease in interlayer compressibility probably due to interlayer stacking transition in FL-CN has been observed at above 3 GPa, which becomes less compressible than that of graphite, accompanied by obvious PL intensity weakening and emission band broadening. The results suggest that interlayer interactions may play dominant roles in the optical properties of FL-CN, shedding new insights into our understanding on PL engineering in g-C3N4.
Visible-light-active g-C3N4/N-doped Sr2Nb2O7 heterojunctions as photocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction	Different visible-light-active g-C3N4/nitrogen-doped Sr2Nb2O7 heterojunction photocatalysts were fabricated by deposition of graphitic carbon nitride over N-doped strontium pyro-niobate prepared by ammonolysis at different temperatures of solvothermally synthesized Sr2Nb2O7 nanorods. Their photocatalytic performance was determined by the amount of hydrogen generated from water reduction under visible light irradiation. The best performing heterojunction was found to be the one formed by g-C3N4 and N-doped Sr2Nb2O7 obtained at 700 degrees C. The enhanced activity of the heterojunction can be explained by better charge separation due to proper bands alignment and intimate contact between the heterojunction components as revealed by electron microscopy. A mechanism for the observed enhanced photocatalytic activity is proposed and supported by band position calculations and photoluminescence data.
Nanoscale Probing of Local Hydrogen Heterogeneity in Disordered Carbon Nitrides with Vibrational Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy	In graphitic carbon nitrides, (photo)catalytic functionality is underpinned by the effect that residual hydrogen content, manifesting in amine (N-H x) defects, has on its optoelectronic properties. Therefore, a detailed understanding of the variation in the local structure of graphitic carbon nitrides is key for understanding structure-activity relationships. Here, we apply aloof-beam vibrational electron energy-loss spectroscopy in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to locally detect variations in hydrogen content in two different layered carbon nitrides with nanometer resolution. Through low dose rate TEM, we obtain atomically resolved images from crystalline and disordered carbon nitrides. By employing an aloof-beam configuration in a monochromated STEM, radiation damage can be dramatically reduced, yielding vibrational spectra from carbon nitrides to be assessed on 10's of nanometer length scales. We find that in disordered graphitic carbon nitrides the relative amine content can vary locally up to 27%. Cyano (C≡N) defects originating from uncondensed precursor are also revealed by probing small volumes, which cannot be detected by infrared absorption or Raman scattering spectroscopies. The utility of this technique is realized for heterogeneous soft materials, such as disordered graphitic carbon nitrides, in which methods to probe catalytically active sites remain elusive.
The primary structure of the major pepsinogen from the gastric mucosa of tuna stomach	The complete primary structure of the major component of tuna pepsinogens was determined by conventional protein chemistry methods. It was composed of a prosegment of 37 residues and a pepsin moiety of 323 residues, having a relative molecular mass of 39,364. The essential aspartyl residues in the active site and the three disulfide bonds common to other pepsinogens were conserved; however, several unique substitutions and/or deletions characteristic of tuna pepsinogen were found at various positions, especially in the prosegment and subsite regions, as compared with the sequences of other pepsinogens, which may affect the rate of activation of the zymogen, and/or the catalytic function and substrate specificity of the enzyme. Tuna pepsinogen is the least acidic among pepsinogens. The sequence identity between tuna pepsinogen and other pepsinogens ranged from 45 to 52%. A phylogenetic tree based on the primary structures suggested that tuna pepsinogen diverged from the pepsinogen A and prochymosin groups in an early period of pepsinogen evolution.
One-step thermal synthesis of Ag-modified g-C3N4/N-doped TiO2 hybrids with enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity	A series of silver nanoparticle-modified graphitic carbon nitride/N-doped TiO2 hybrids (Ag/g-C3N4/N-TiO2 or ACTs) were prepared by one-step in situ calcination process at 550 A degrees C for 3 h in air atmosphere. The morphology, structure, and optical properties of ACTs with different Ag contents were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectra, and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Ag nanoparticles with grain size of about 5 nm are anchored on the surface of ACTs. In UV-vis absorption test, a red-shift of light absorption edge and more visible light absorption (compared to N-TiO2 and g-C3N4/N-TiO2) are observed for ACTs. Moreover, the dependence of photocatalytic activity on Ag contents was investigated, and ACTs-3 presents the highest photocatalytic activity as the optimal Ag content under visible light irradiation. Remarkably enhanced UV-visible light photoelectrochemical response was also confirmed for ACTs compared with TiO2, N-TiO2, and g-C3N4/N-TiO2. Ag-decorated g-C3N4/N-TiO2 composites result in enhanced light absorption capacity and improved transfer of charge carriers, which prominently contribute to the improvement of photoactivity. This work demonstrates that Ag/g-C3N4/N-TiO2 is a promising photocatalytic material for organic pollutant degradation under visible light irradiation.
Facile Synthesis of MgO/C3N4 Nanocomposite for Removal of Reactive Orange 16 Under Visible Light	In this research, MgO/C3N4 nanocomposite was synthesized via facile and economical method and was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Field emission scanning electron microscopy, Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Dot mapping. Then efficiency of synthesized MgO/C3N4 nanocomposite was investigated in removal of Reactive Orange 16 (RO16) dye from aqueous solutions under visible light in a batch system. Results obtained from photocatalytic removal showed that removal percentage of RO16 dye decreases by increasing RO16 dye concentration and increasing MgO/C3N4 nanocomposite dosage. The optimum pH for the removal of RO16 was pH 6. As results, maximum removal of RO16 dye was obtained about 82% in following conditions: Visible light radiation=39.6 w, RO16 dye concentration=2 mg/L, MgO/C3N4 nanocomposite, dosage=0.2 g/500 mL, pH 6, time=30 min. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the synthesized MgO/C3N4 nanocomposite can be used as an efficient photocatalyst under visible light for the removal of RO16 dye.
Design and application of active sites in g-C3N4-based photocatalysts	With the development in photocatalysis field, photocatalysts have received increasing attention due to their important role in environmental pollution and energy crisis. As a nonmetallic photocatalyst, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been widely recognized because of its excellent optical properties, low cost, and environment friendliness. In the g-C3N4 intrinsic frameworks, carbon atom tends to be the reducing active site, while nitrogen atom tends to be the oxidizing active site and reducing active site according to the difference of electronegativity. However, the quantity and quality of these active sites are affected by many factors, including C-N covalent bonds, surface properties, etc. Active sites play an important role in photocatalysis; however, this role is not detailed in most reports. In this review, we proposed the following possible mechanisms of active sites in improving the photocatalytic activity of traditional g-C3N4 based on its intrinsic: morphology regulation, carrier migration, surface active treatment, and substrate adsorption. The following factors affecting the active sites of g-C3N4, including basal engineering and hybrid engineering, were also investigated. The roles of these active sites in improving the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4-based photocatalytic materials, including morphology regulation, surface treatment, heteroatom doping, and interfacial interaction, were also expounded. Current challenges and future development of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts that are rich in active surface sites were also discussed. This review provides an in-depth understanding of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The editorial office of Journal of Materials Science & Technology.
Barrier coating for polymer light-emitting diodes using carbon nitride thin films deposited at low temperature by PECVD technique	
One-step synthesis of nitrogen-defective graphitic carbon nitride for improving photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.	Defects are significant for graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4, CN) in photocatalytic applications. Defective CN not only accelerate charge separation but also extend spectral response. Engineering carbon or nitrogen defects in CN has been achieved by variety of strategies, but it is still a long-term interest to develop a simple and controllable route for engineering defects in CN. Herein, we present tuning the nitrogen defects in CN by either changing the heating rate or prolonging the pyrolysis time during polymerization melamine sulfate. It was found that either lower heating rate or longer pyrolysis time lead to the formation of more N vacancies and suspended terminal amino. As a result, an optimal photocatalytic H2 yield rate (lambda>420nm) of 905mumolg-1 h-1 was reached, which was 2 times higher than that of CN prepared with a heating rate of 1°C/min and pyrolysis at 600°C for 4h.

NO removal efficiency of high-yield carbon nitride irradiated under various light sources	Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a well-known photocatalyst. In this work, the NO removal efficiency of g-C3N4 irradiated under various light sources is explored. For achieving high productivity and activity photocatalyst, the pyrolysis temperature is adjusted from 450 degrees C to 600 degrees C. All prepared g-C3N4 are put into a transparent reaction box one by one to remove the NO with the initial concentration of 1000 ppb level in air flow under real indoor illumination of three light resources: metal halide lamp, LED lamp and high pressure sodium lamp. According to the photocatalytic reaction results, the NO removal ratio of g-C3N4 synthesized under 500 degrees C can reach to 29.26% under the irradiation of metal halide lamp, overwhelming that of g-C3N4 irradiated under other light sources. Several characterization methods were adopt to analyze the photocatalytic reaction mechanism and the micro structures of g-C3N4 prepared from melamine. Because of the conduction band potential difference between g-C3N4 and melem, heterojunction of melem and g-C3N4 can form the conventiontype charge transfer, which greatly reduce the combination ratio of photogenerated electrons and holes, thus enhance the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 under the irradiation of metal halide lamp indicating why the g-C3N4 synthesized under 500 degrees C possesses the best NO removal efficiency among these samples. In addition, compared with other lamps, metal halide lamp is proved to be the most suitable light resource to motivate g-C3N4 because of its relatively concentrated light intensity. The present work provide us new perspectives for selecting suitable light resources and proper synthesis conditions for the generation of g-C3N4 to achieve better air purification performance in tunnels and indoors.
Graphitic carbon nitride: Effects of various precursors on the structural, morphological and electrochemical sensing properties	Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been discovered very long ago, in the 1830s. g-C3N4, an analogue of graphene, has been of great interest due to the strong electron donor nature of nitrogen present in g-C3N4, which is absent in graphene. Though studies have shown that g-C3N4 can be used as an electrochemical sensing platform for electrochemical study of H2O2, glucose, mercuric ions, nitrobenzene and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), few studies have been conducted to investigate the electrochemical behaviours of g-C3N4 produced by various precursors (bulk condensation pyrolysis of nitrogen-rich precursors): trithiocyanuric acid (C3N4-TC), triazinetrihydrazine (C3N4-TH), cyanuric acid (C3N4-CA), cyanuric chloride (C3N4-CC), dicyandiamide (C3N4-DD) and melamine (C3N4-ME) on important biomarkers: ascorbic acid, dopamine, uric acid and adenine and to observe any enhanced performance over glassy carbon (GC). In this work, the performance of g-C3N4 materials on the electrochemical sensing of biomarkers is analysed with cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry techniques. Among the g-C3N4 materials tested, C3N4-TC and C3N4-CA surfaces exhibited lower over-potentials for the electrochemical sensing of the biomarkers as compared to GC. In addition, these two surfaces showed great sensitivity and good linearity for the biomarkers tested. This work provides a good understanding of the electrochemical properties of g-C-3 N-4 materials synthesized from various precursors as well as the effectiveness of the g-C-3 N-4 materials as electrochemical sensing platform.

Z-Scheme Photocatalytic Systems for Carbon Dioxide Reduction: Where Are We Now?	Transforming CO2 into fuels by utilizing sunlight is promising to synchronously overcome global warming and energy-supply issues. It is crucial to design efficient photocatalysts with intriguing features such as robust light-harvesting ability, strong redox potential, high charge-separation, and excellent durability. Hitherto, a single-component photocatalyst is incapable to simultaneously meet all these criteria. Inspired by natural photosynthesis, constructing artificial Z-scheme photocatalysts provides a facile way to conquer these bottlenecks. In this review, we firstly introduce the fundamentals of photocatalytic CO2 reduction and Z-scheme systems. Thereafter we discuss state-of-the-art Z-scheme photocatalytic CO2 reduction, whereby special attention is placed on the predominant factors that affect photoactivity. Additionally, further modifications that are important for efficient photocatalysis are reviewed.
Sonoprecipitation fabrication of enhanced electron transfer Cu(OH)(2)/g-C3N4 nanophotocatalyst with promoted H-2-Production activity under visible light irradiation	A series of Cu(OH)(2)/g-C3N4 photocatalysts were fabricated via precipitation and sonoprecipitation. Various physicochemical and electrochemical techniques were employed to investigate the physical and optical properties of the samples, while their photocatalytic performance was studied based on the water splitting. Based on the observations, Cu(OH)(2) was nominated as an stable and highly efficient nonprecious cocatalyst for photocatalytic H-2 generation. 4Cu(OH)(2)/C3N4(U) sample demonstrated the highest performance (187 mu mol/h/g) among the other samples with various loading of Cu(OH)(2) which is 31 times higher than pure C3N4. This enhancement was because of the important role of Cu(OH)(2) as electron traps and active sites. Additionally, the photoactivity of the sono-synthesized photocatalyst was significantly higher than the one synthesized by precipitation method by 67%. The findings confirmed the promoting influence of ultrasound irradiation on providing well intimate cocatalyst-semiconductor interfacial contact, higher surface area and better dispersion of cocatalysts. This could facilitate the efficient transfer of electrons to cocatalyst and decrease charge carriers recombination where supported by PL, EIS and transient photocurrent results. This study addresses the sonochemical method as a promised rout for fabrication of a closely contact interface which is a key parameter to achieve more efficient noble metal free cocatalysts.

Photocatalytic 4-nitrophenol degradation and oxygen evolution reaction in CuO/g-C3N4 composites prepared by deep eutectic solvent-assisted chlorine doping	Anion doping into the oxygen site as a new plan for tuning the physical and chemical properties of metal oxides and adjusting their catalytic behavior has been studied. Herein, we report a Cl- anion-doped CuO (Cl-CuO) preparation method using deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as a green solvent, and the Cl-CuO/g-C3N4 heterostructure was successfully prepared in various weight ratios via a simple ultrasonication and mixing method for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media and the photocatalytic degradation of 4-nitrophenol. Cl- was doped into the CuO crystal lattice, as revealed by the XRD and XPS studies. The as-prepared Cl-CuO/g-C3N4 (1 : 2) exhibited a low overpotential of 0.77 V on the glassy carbon electrode with a current density of 33 mA cm-2 at 2.4 V for OER in an acidic solution. Also, about 92% degradation of 20 ppm of 4-nitrophenol was achieved for Cl-CuO/g-C3N4 (1 : 2) in 100 minutes under the irradiation of a 35 W Xe arc lamp. We also evaluated the effect of thermal energy on degradation kinetics by tuning the temperature, which led us to the quantification of various thermodynamic parameters. To the best of knowledge, this is one of the new methods of green synthesis to fabricate photocatalysts for energy and environmental studies.
Morphological behaviour of osteoblasts on diamond-like carbon coating and amorphous C-N film in organ culture	Similar to diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating, amorphous carbon nitride (C-N) films can be extremely hard and wear-resistant. They may serve as candidates for the solution to the problem of aseptic loosening of total hip replacements. Morphological behaviour of osteoblasts on silicon, DLC-coated silicon and amorphous C-N film-deposited silicon in organ culture was investigated by scanning electron microscopy. Cells on the silicon wafers were able to attach, but were unable to follow this attachment with spreading. In contrast, the cells attached, spread and proliferated on the DLC coatings and amorphous C-N films without apparent impairment of cell physiology. The morphological development of cells on the coatings and films was similar to that of cells in the control. The preliminary results support the biocompatibility of DLC coating and are encouraging for the potential biomedical applications of amorphous C-N film.
Fe2O3/C-C3N4-Based Tight Heterojunction for Boosting Visible Light-Driven Photocatalytic Water Oxidation	Recently, photocatalytic water splitting for clean hydrogen (H-2) energy through the use of solar energy has been considered to be a promising means of renewable energy conversion. Because of the high activation barriers of oxygen (O-2) generation, the half reaction, i.e., water oxidation, is the rate-limiting steps of the overall water splitting efficiency. Photocatalysts with high activity and nonmetal usage are needed. Herein, we report one new thin-layered heterojunction sample of Fe2O3/C-C3N4, containing layered alpha-Fe2O3 and carbon-coated g-C3N4, obtained through one simple repeatable solid-state synthesis strategy. The layered FeOOH and g-C3N4 are first synthesized working as the precursors. Under N-2 atmosphere and 580 degrees C, the dehydration of FeOOH happens, and it transfers into layered alpha-Fe2O3; the water vapor destroys the van der Waals force of g-C3N4 and induces the parts of edge carbonization. Under the synergistic effect of vapor and heating, the thin-layered Fe2O3/C-C3N4 heterojunction is obtained. Without cocatalyst addition, the obtained sample shows efficient visible-light-driven photocatalytic water oxidation performance, i.e., a 22.3 mu mol/h oxygen evolution rate under the LED lamp of lambda = 420 nm illumination, 3, 16, and 30 times higher than reference Fe2O3/C3N4, bare alpha-Fe2O3, and g-C3N4, respectively. The key parameters for the enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributable to the carbon layer and the tight contact structure, which can work as the carrier (electrons from g-C3N4 and holes from alpha-Fe2O3) collection center and provide the small migration resistance. Moreover, the carbon shows a different migration rate for electrons and holes and then facilitates the separation of carriers to some extent. To our knowledge, no other papers on Fe2O3/C-C3N4-based photocatalytic water oxidation have been reported. This work can provide a new insight for synthesis of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts, and also help us understand the water oxidation reaction.
Gold nanorods/g-C3N4 heterostructures for plasmon-enhanced photocatalytic H 2 evolution in visible and near-infrared light	Recently, broad spectrum (visible and near-infrared (NIR)) light utilization has aroused widespread attention in the research of photocatalysis. While g-C3N4, highly stable, cheap and easily synthesized, shows H2 evolution activity under visible light irradiation, it doesn't perform under NIR light irradiation. Here we report an Au nanorods (NRs)/g-C3N4 heterostructure with Au nanorods on g-C3N4's surface. The most exciting feature of designed Au NRs/g-C3N4 heterostructures is that Au nanorods themselves are excited by visible and NIR light, which produce hot electrons and inject into g-C3N4. The photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of Au NRs/g-C3N4 heterostructures (350.6 μmol g-1 h-1) is nearly 4 times higher than that of g-C3N4 with Pt as cocatalyst (68.9 μmol g-1 h-1) under visible light illumination. The improved photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the increasing visible light-absorbing capacity of transverse surface plasmon resonance (TSPR) of Au nanorods and improved charge separation of Au NRs/g-C3N4 heterostructure. Even more important, Au NRs/g-C3N4 heterostructures achieve NIR photocatalytic H2 evolution performance (63.1 μmol g-1 h-1), owing to the longitudinal SPR (LSPR) effect of Au nanorods induced NIR light harvesting ability.
A multifunctional graphene-based nanofiltration membrane under photo-assistance for enhanced water treatment based on layer-by-layer sieving	Nanofiltration (NF) provides an effective strategy for rejecting large organic molecules. However, attaining high permeability, antifouling ability and good selectivity simultaneously still remains a crucial task for existing NF technologies. Herein, we built a photo-assisted multifunctional NF membrane assembled with g-C3N4, TiO2, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene oxide (GO), in which CNTs not only expand the interlayer space between neighbored graphene sheets, but also enhance the stability and strength of GO layer. Benefiting from the photo assistance, our NF membranes show an enhanced water flux (similar to 16 L m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1)), while keep a high dye rejection (similar to 100% for Methyl Orange). The photo-assisted NF membranes also display good rejection ratio for salt ions (i.e., 67% for Na2SO4) due to the layer-by-layer sieving. Meanwhile, the NF membrane coupled with photocatalysis exhibits a multifunctional characteristic for the efficient removal of ammonia (50%), antibiotic (80%) and bisphenol A (82%) in water. Besides, the performance of integrated system is also tested by treating the real aquaculture wastewater to evaluate its practical application ability. The lost flux of the fouled membrane is effectively recovered by the photochemically assisted process. Hence, this work mitigates the longstanding challenge of GO-based NF membranes in large-scale application by integrating photocatalysis and nanofiltration technologies.
Ultrasonic energy-assisted in-situ synthesis of Ru-0/PANI/g-C3N4 nanocomposite: Application for picomolar-level electrochemical detection of endocrine disruptor (Bisphenol-A) in humans and animals	Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine-disrupting chemical which resembles structurally the hormone estrogen. Even a trace amount of BPA can bind estrogen receptors resulting in the inducement of reproductive disorders, cancers and problems related to sexual growth such as manliness in female and womanliness in male. So the determination of BPA in human and animal bodies is very essential. For this purpose, a new nanocomposite composed of ruthenium nanoparticles, polyaniline and graphitic carbon nitride (Ru-0/PANI/g-C3N4) has been synthesized ultrasonically (40 +/- 3 kHz, 200 W). A modification on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with the nanocomposite detects BPA in human and animal urine samples with wide linear range (0.01-1.1 mu M) and the limit of detection is pico molar-level. The synthesized nanocomposite was characterized by Ultraviolet-Visible and Fourier Transform-Infra Red spectroscopies, thermo gravimetric analysis, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction study, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, and elemental mapping analysis. This sensing system is selective, stable and reusable, by which the detection of BPA in various physiological fluids is very much possible.
A New and stable Mo-Mo2C modified g-C3N4 photocatalyst for efficient visible light photocatalytic H-2 production	Design and preparation of highly efficient and stable cocatalysts are critical to the improvement of photocatalyst performance. A traditional cocatalyst consists of metal nanoparticles for the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs and for the reduction of protons. In this research we report a metal-semiconductor composite cocatalyst to increase light adsorption and to effectively enhance proton reduction capacity. A molybdenum rich molybdenum carbide (Mo-Mo2C) based noble-metal-free metal/semiconductor cocatalyst was loaded onto graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) for highly efficient photocatalytic H-2 evolution from water. The Mo-Mo2C was synthesized via a temperature-programmed reaction using (NH4)(6)Mo7O24.4H(2)O as a precursor. The cocatalyst loaded 2.0 wt.% Mo-Mo2C/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst has demonstrated excellent photocatalytic performance. The hydrogen evolution rate for the 2.0 wt.% Mo-Mo2C/g-C3N4 nanocomposites can be as high as 219.7 mu mol h(-1)g(-1), which is 440 times higher than that of g-C3N4 alone and 90% as high as 0.5 wt.% Pt/g-C3N4 photocatalyst (244.1 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)). Due to strong synergetic effects between Mo and Mo2C nanoparticles, this rate is 11.47 and 3.60 times higher than those for 2.0 wt.% Mo/g-C3N4 (19.1 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) and 2.0 wt.% Mo2C/g-C3N4 (60.9 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) photocatalysts respectively. Moreover, the 2.0 wt.% Mo-Mo2C/g-C3N4 catalyst is significantly stable for application in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, with an apparent quantum efficiency of 8.3% one of the highest noble-metal-free efficiencies reported in literature. All results indicate that metal/semiconductor composites can serve as highly efficient cocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water reduction.
Study on surface sensitization of g-C3N4 by functioned different aggregation behavior porphyrin and its optical properties	Tetracarboxyl-phenyl porphyrin (TCPP) hybridized graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) composites have been facilely synthesized through grinding method and ethanol dispersion. TCPP molecules as a sensitizer could easily assemble on the surface of g-C3N4 nanosheets mainly through 7C-7C stacking interaction. The TCPP-g-C3N4 com-posite is employed to optical waveguide (OWG) gas sensor, and its aggregation behaviors in different pH condition are studied by UV-vis spectroscopy and the corresponding morphologies are observed by SEM. It is found that the TCPP-g-C3N4 film under basic condition (pH 1/4 11), where TCPP formed H type aggregation on the film surface, has fine response to SO2 (0.1-100 ppm) and H2S (1-100 ppm). The gas-sensitive mechanism is protonation and deprotonation process, in terms of UV-vis spectroscopy.
Ultrathin graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets: a low-cost, green, and highly efficient electrocatalyst toward the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and its glucose biosensing application	In this communication, we demonstrate for the first time that ultrathin graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets can serve as a low-cost, green, and highly efficient electrocatalyst toward the reduction of hydrogen peroxide. We further demonstrate its application for electrochemical glucose biosensing in both buffer solution and human serum medium with a detection limit of 11 μM and 45 μM, respectively.
Novel Magnetic Retrievable Visible-Light-Driven Ternary Fe 3 O 4@NiFe 2 O 4/Phosphorus-Doped g-C3N4 Nanocomposite Photocatalyst with Significantly Enhanced Activity through a Double-Z-Scheme System	Nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) and magnetite (Fe3O4) are established earth-abundant materials and get tremendous attention because of magnetic and high photocatalytic activity. First we fabricated novel Fe3O4@20 wt % NiFe2O4/phosphorus-doped g-C3N4 (M@NFOPCN) using a convenient simple coprecipitation method followed by calcination at 400 °C. Then M@NFOPCN composites were prepared by the in situ growth of Fe3O4 nanorods and cubes on the surfaces of a porous agglomerated NFOPCN nanostructure, varying the weight percentage of Fe3O4. A series of characterizations like X-ray diffraction, UV-vis diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy, photoluminescence, Fourier transform infrared, thermogravimetric analysis-differential thermal analysis, vibrating-sample magnetometry, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques confirm that changing weight percentage of M can constructively control the textural characteristics, internal strain, size of the crystals, and other aspects meant for photocatalytic activity. When M was coupled with NFOPCN, magnetic loss was lowered and also an appreciable saturation magnetization (Ms) was obtained. 40 wt % M@NFOPCN showed admirable photostability and was capable of evolving 924 μmol h-1 H2 when irradiated under visible light. The percentage of degradation for ciprofloxacin (CIP) by this ternary nanocomposite was almost 2-fold greater than those of the pure M and NFOPCN photocatalysts. A plausible photocatalytic mechanism for the degradation of CIP antibiotic was established. Hence, this study presents a reusable, low-cost, noble-metal-free, environmentally friendly, fast, and highly efficient 40 wt % M@NFOPCN photocatalyst, achieving 90% degradation of CIP antibiotic under visible light. The double-Z scheme triggers charge separation and migration, enhances visible-light harvesting, and helps in internal electric-field creation, thus headed toward dramatic augmentation of the photocatalytic activity.
Preparation of luminescent graphitic C3N4 NS and their composites with RGO for property controlling	Thin graphitic C3N4 nanosheets (g-C3N4 NS) with bright blue photoluminescence were prepared through an acid and alkali corrosion and ultrasonic-assisted method. g-C3N4 NS/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sample which was prepared through a hydrothermal synthesis offered high separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated carriers because of the thin g-C3N4 NS attached closely to the RGO. The introduction of RGO sheets provided prominent advantages for enhanced light absorption and promoted the transfer rate of photogenerated carriers from g-C3N4 NS. A g-C3N4 NS/RGO (3 : 2) composite not only functions as a sensor to detect Pb2+ and Cd2+ in an aqueous solution but also exhibits efficient visible-light photocatalytic performance. The application in a sensor is ascribed to the intercalation impact between thin g-C3N4 NS and heavy metal ions. Owing to the presence of more active functional groups (e.g., carboxyl and amino groups) on the surface of the g-C3N4 NS compared with the bulk form, the ions can be easily adsorbed onto g-C3N4 NS. The g-C3N4 NS/RGO composites are highly sensitive and selective in ion sensing, as well as having superior photocatalytic activity.

TiO2-g-C3N4 composite materials for photocatalytic H-2 evolution under visible light irradiation	In this investigation we report the preparation of TiO2-g-C3N4 composite materials with varying the wt % of g-C3N4 the characterization of these materials by various techniques and photocatalync hydrogen production under visible light irradiation in the presence of methanol The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) shows that the composite materials are consist of anatase TiO2 and g-C3N4 Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra show that the absorbance band intensity of composite materials was stronger than that of C3N4 The UV-vis absorption spectra show that the absorption edge of the composite materials shifts to the lower energy region comparing to pure anatase and to longer wavelengths with increasing the amount of C3N4 The significant photoluminescence quenching was observed in TiO2-g-C3N4 composite materials indicating the charge transfer from C3N4 to TiO2 The visible light induced H-2 evolution rate was remarkably enhanced by coupling TiO2 with C3N4 (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved
Ultrathin porous g-C3N4 nanosheets modified with AuCu alloy nanoparticles and C-C coupling photothermal catalytic reduction of CO2 to ethanol	Here, we report ultrathin porous g-C3N4 nanosheets modified with AuCu alloy NPs for photothermalcatalytic CO2 reduction to ethanol. The positive charge on the Au surface improves the adsorption of CO2 molecules and the charge transfer from Au to Cu in the alloy enriches Cu with excessive negative charges, promoting the formation of intermediates CO2 center dot- and *CO on the surface of Cu. The strong interaction between the metal and g-C3N4 accelerates the migration of photogenerated charges. The increase of temperature leads to the enhancement of the thermal motion of the molecules, resulting in the synergy of photocatalysis and thermal catalysis, which promotes the formation of C-C coupling by *CO polymerization, so that the yield of CH3CH2OH was increased. At 120 degrees C, the yield and selectivity of ethanol are 0.89 mmol.g(-1).h(-1) and 93.1% for 1.0 wt% AuCu/g-C3N4, which are 4.2 times that of photocatalysis and 7.6 times that of thermal catalysis.
Post-synthetic regulation of the structure, morphology and photoactivity of graphitic carbon nitride by heat-vacuum treatment	This work provides a simple but efficient strategy for the adjustment of texture and regular morphology of graphitic carbon nitride (CN) material by the post-synthesis of successive heat-vacuum treatment (SHVT) method without using hard templates. The modified CN displayed various hollow microtubule structure and the improvement of s-heptazine unit depending on the SHVT temperature. The best hollow microtubule morphology with highest contents of the key s-heptazine structure can be achieved by SHVT at 540 degrees C. These modified CN samples led to the highest photocatalytic H-2 yield of 1160 mu L for 4 h reaction under visible light irradiation, which is almost 10 times higher than that of the traditional CN (118 mu L). The results represent an alternative approach to preparing hollow microtubule morphology and improving the s-heptazine structure in CN for enhancing photocatalytic performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A mass-spectrometric sequence study of the enzyme ribitol dehydrogenase from Klebsiella aerogenes	The first detailed results of the application of a low-resolution mixture analysis approach to the sequence analysis of an enzyme, ribitol dehydrogenase, are given. Examples of the interpretation of the spectra of peptide mixtures derived from this protein are described. Evidence for new fragmentation patterns observed is reported, together with an explanation of the generation of ambiguous sequences by use of a low-specificity enzyme, thermolysin. The overall sequencing strategy evolved is assessed.
A novel photofunctional g-C3N4/Ag3PO4 bulk heterojunction for decolorization of Rh.B	A novel photofunctional graphitic carbon nitride/silver phosphate (g-C3N4/Ag3PO4) bulk heterojunction has been reported for photodecolorization of Rhodamine B (Rh.B), which was synthesized step-by-step by the ion-impregnating method. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra showed that the g-C3N4/Ag3PO4 bulk heterojunction has two intense optical absorption edges corresponding to g-C3N4 and Ag3PO4 in the visible light region. Photoluminescence spectra confirmed that the separation efficiency of photogenerated charges in the heterojunction was more intensive than pristine g-C3N4. Furthermore, the vectorial charge transfer at the g-C3N4/Ag3PO4 interface could be confirmed by photocurrent response. The g-C3N4/Ag3PO4 heterojunction with 5:1 weight ratio exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity for decolorization of Rh.B which was higher than that of pristine g-C3N4 and Ag3PO4.

Roles of N-Vacancies over Porous g-C3N4 Microtubes during Photocatalytic NO x Removal	The development of catalysts that effectively activate target pollutants and promote their complete conversion is an admirable objective in the environmental photocatalysis field. In this work, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) microtubes with tunable N-vacancy concentrations were controllably fabricated using an in situ soft-chemical method. The morphological evolution of g-C3N4, from the bulk to the porous tubular architecture, is discussed in detail with the aid of time-resolved hydrothermal experiments. We found that the NO removal ratio and apparent reaction rate constant of the g-C3N4 microtubes were 1.8 and 2.6 times higher than those of pristine g-C3N4, respectively. By combining detailed experimental characterization and density functional theory calculations, the effects of N-vacancies in the g-C3N4 microtubes on O2 and NO adsorption activation, electron capture, and electronic structure were systematically investigated. These results demonstrate that surface N-vacancies act as specific sites for the adsorption activation of reactants and photoinduced electron capture, while enhancing the light-absorbing capability of g-C3N4. Moreover, the porous wall structures of the as-prepared g-C3N4 microtubes facilitate the diffusion of reactants, and their tubular architectures favor the oriented transfer of charge carriers. The intermediates formed during photocatalytic NO removal processes were identified by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, and different reaction pathways over pristine and N-deficient g-C3N4 are proposed. This study provides a feasible strategy for air pollution control over g-C3N4 by introducing N-vacancy and porous tubular architecture simultaneously.
Electrochemiluminescence energy resonance transfer in 2D/2D heterostructured g-C3N4/MnO 2 for glutathione detection	The energy transfer efficiency, strongly depending on the distance of donor-acceptor pair, is always a crucial factor for the construction of elegant electrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET)-based biosensors. In this paper, a novel and efficient ECL-RET in 2D/2D heterostructured g-C3N4/MnO2 was developed using g-C3N4 nanosheets (g-C3N4 NSs) as energy donor and MnO2 nanosheets (MnO2 NSs) as energy acceptor. In this system, MnO2 NSs in-situ grew on g-C3N4 NSs to form the 2D/2D heterostructure, greatly shortening the distance of the donor-acceptor pair (g-C3N4-MnO2) and thus greatly enhancing the RET efficiency. To demonstrate the performance of the system, a signal "off-on" ECL sensor was designed for glutathione (GSH) analysis. In the absence of GSH, MnO2 significantly quenched the ECL intensity of g-C3N4 owing to ECL-RET in this 2D/2D g-C3N4/MnO2 heterostructure (ECL signal "off"). Upon the addition of GSH, MnO2 was reduced to Mn2+ by GSH and g-C3N4 was released from the heterostructured g-C3N4/MnO2, generating a recovery of ECL intensity (ECL signal "on"). Under the optimal conditions, the designed ECL-RET signal "off-on" sensor realized the sensitive detection of GSH ranged from 0.2-100 μM with the detection limit of 0.05 μM. Furthermore, the as-prepared ECL-RET sensor exhibits good performance in the determination of GSH in human serum samples. The ECL-RET in 2D/2D heterostructure provides an ingenious way for the exploitation of novel ECL biosensing systems.
Primary structure of Euplotes raikovi pheromones: comparison of five sequences of pheromones from cells with variable mating interactions	The amino acid sequences of five pheromones, Er-2, Er-3, Er-9, Er-11, and Er-20, secreted by cells of different mating types of the ciliated protozoa Euplotes raikovi, have been determined by automated Edman analyses of the whole proteins and germane fragments. In each case, the molecular mass was determined by plasma desorption or laser desorption mass spectrometry and was in excellent agreement with the calculated values. Where available, the determined sequences were also in accord with the corresponding segments of the precursor molecules predicted from relevant nucleic acid sequences. Of the five, two were found to be identical (Er-2 and Er-9) and one (Er-3) was identical to a pheromone previously sequenced (Er-1), even though mating pair formation was found to take place (although to a limited extent) when cells secreting those pheromones were combined in a mixture. Comparison of the five unique sequences suggested a closer relationship between Er-1 (Er-3) and Er-10 and between Er-11 and Er-20 (44% and 56% identity, respectively) than was generally observed among the other members. This pairing was also supported by hydrophobicity analyses. Interestingly, Er-20 cannot, as a rule, induce cell union in any of the other cell types, including cells secreting Er-11, despite the fact that Er-20 and Er-11 are the most similar of the five unique sequences. Thus sequence identity and secondary structure profiles are not a good indicator of biological relatedness as manifested in heterologous receptor interaction.
Graphene-Based Non-Noble-Metal Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Acid	Non-noble-metal catalysts based on Fe-N-C moieties have shown promising oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this study, we report a facile method to prepare a Fe-N-C catalyst based on modified graphene (Fe-N-rGO) from heat treatment of a mixture of Fe salt, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), and chemically reduced graphene (rGO). The Fe-N-rGO catalyst was found to have pyridinic N-dominant heterocyclic N (40% atomic concentration among all N components) on the surface and have an average Fe coordination of similar to 3 N (Fe-N-3,N-average) in bulk. Rotating disk electrode measurements revealed that Fe-N-rGO had high mass activity in acid and exhibited high stability at 0.5 V at 80 degrees C in acid over 70 h, which was correlated to low H2O2 production shown from rotating ring disk electrode measurements.
Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution via Pt@Au NRs/C3N4 Nanotubes under Visible-Light Irradiation	Au nanorods (NRs) decorated carbon nitride nanotubes (Au NRs/CNNTs) photocatalysts have been designed and prepared by impregnation-annealing approach. Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peaks of Au NRs can be adjusted by changing the aspect ratios, and the light absorption range of Au NRs/CNNTs is extended to longer wavelength even near-infrared light. Optimal composition of Pt@Au NR769/CNNT650 has been achieved by adjusting the LSPR peaks of Au NRs and further depositing Pt nanoparticles (NPs), and the photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate is 207.0 mu mol h(-1) (20 mg catalyst). Preliminary LSPR enhancement photocatalytic mechanism is suggested. On one hand, LSPR of Au NRs is beneficial for visible-light utilization. On the other hand, Pt NPs and Au NRs have a synergetic enhancement effect on photocatalytic H-2 evolution of CNNTs, in which the local electromagnetic field can improve the photogenerated carrier separation and direct electron transfer increases the hot electron concentration while Au NRs as the electron channel can well restrain charge recombination, finally Pt as co-catalyst can boost H+ reduction rate. This work provides a new way to develop efficient photocatalysts for splitting water, which can simultaneously extend light absorption range and facilitate carrier generation, transportation and reduce carrier recombination.
A simple "on-off-on" ECL sensor for glucose determination based on Pd nanowires and Ag doped g-C3N4 nanosheets	One-dimensional Pd nanowires (PdNWs) and Ag doped g-C3N4 nanosheets (Ag-g-C3N4 NSs) were prepared and applied to construct a simple "on-off-on" ECL sensor for glucose detection. Compared to some complex and time-consuming synthetic procedures, in this work, Ag-g-C3N4 NSs were prepared via one step thermal polymerization of melamine and AgNO3 without any handling to get the layered structure. PdNW-functionalized Ag-g-C3N4 NSs were used as luminophores, which displayed prominent ECL performance and superior efficient electron transport capacity. Combining PdNW-functionalized Ag-g-C3N4 NSs with the competitive binding reaction of the glucose-ConA-dextran system, the prepared "on-off-on" sensor showed high sensitivity and wide linearity for glucose detection. The linear range was 1.0 x 10(-11) M to 1.67 x 10(-6) M and the detection limit was 3.0 x 10(-12) M (S/N = 3).
Highly selective and rapid non-enzymatic glucose sensing at ultrathin layered Nb doped C3N4 for extended linearity range	Ultrathin layered graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) doped with niobium (Nb) metal has been prepared from urea by pyrolysis method and applied for direct glucose sensing in human blood. Two different oxidation peaks during both forward and reverse potential scanning were observed, similar to metal electrodes, indicating the metallic behavior of the g-Nb-C3N4. The oxidation peak appeared at 0.39 V indicates the oxidation of glucose to gluconolactone, which gets further oxidized to CO2 and H2O during reverse scan indicated by the appearance of very intense reverse peak. The sensor gave an extended wide dynamic range from 0.5 mM to 200 mM with an excellent sensitivity of 1.62 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2). Micahelis-Menten kinetic constant K-M of 181 mM observed is 100 times higher than the un-doped g-C3N4. The developed sensor electrode is tested for glucose sensing in the human blood samples and showed good signal recovery for 4 times reuse.
Ternary g-C3N4/ZnNCN@ZIF-8 Hybrid Photocatalysts with Robust Interfacial Interactions and Enhanced CO2 Reduction Performance	Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the main greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and its concentration continues to rise, which has become a global environmental problem. The artificial photosynthesis technology involving the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to solar fuels is one of the most promising strategies to reduce CO2 and utilize it to produce alternative chemical energy such as methane and methanol. Unfortunately, photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance based on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is usually limited by poor charge separation ability and limited CO2 adsorption ability. Herein, novel ternary g-C3N4/ZnNCN@ZIF-8 hybrid photocatalysts with robust interfacial interactions via Zn-N bonding are constructed by sequential in situ interfacial reactions, to overcome the aforementioned two shortcomings and to enhance photocatalytic CO2 conversion efficiency. Because of the synergetic effects of g-C3N4/ZnNCN interfacial Z-scheme heterostructuring and surface-passivated ZIF-8 grafting in improving light harvesting ability, enhancing CO2 capture capacity, and promoting interfacial charge transfer efficiency, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of novel ternary g-C3N4/ZnNCN@ZIF-8 hybrid photocatalyst is significantly improved by 104.6%, relative to that of g-C3N4. This study will offer new insights for exploiting novel efficient g-C3N4-based hybrid photocatalyst systems for artificial photosynthesis and in modulating the complex photocatalytic processes systematically.
Gender assessment of job stress in healthcare workers. Implications for practice	N, P dual-doped carbon nanosheets was prepared by an in-situ foaming technology. The crude lecithin extracted from egg yolk was explored to prepare this novel carbon material. In the synthesis process, the crude lecithin molecular is as the Gemini surfactant and the graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) plays the role of self-sacrificing template. At the high temperature, the sandwich-mixture "lecithin/C3N4/lecithin" expanded and carbonized with the decomposition of g-C3N4 . This induces the formation of many mull-wrinkled nanosheets and synchronously constitute a mull-doped carbon foam. This unique carbon material exhibits a super-efficient catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reaction, with the limited current density of 6.7 mA cm(-2) tested at 1600 rpm in 0.1 M KOH solution, which is far larger than that of Pt/C(20%) catalyst (5.5 mA cm(-2) ). It was demonstrated that this novel catalyst also possesses great catalytic stability. After about 9 h continuous test, the current density of this catalyst remained above 91%. These results demonstrate that the N, P dual-doped multi-wrinkled carbon nanosheets can be used as the high-efficient metal-free electrocatalyst towards oxygen reduction reaction.
Turn-On fluorescence sensor based detection of heavy metal ion using carbon dots@graphitic-carbon nitride nanocomposite probe	
CL glycoprotein is the tissue form of type VI collagen	CL glycoprotein (CLGP), the 140,000-dalton collagenous glycoprotein, has been isolated from fetal bovine aorta and nuchal ligament, in milligram amounts in its reduced and alkylated form, using a multistage procedure. This material exhibited a characteristic amino acid composition with a consistent ratio of hydroxylysine to hydroxyproline (approximately 1:1). Digestion of CLGP with bacterial collagenase yielded three discrete noncollagenous fragments. Monospecific anti-CLGP antiserum exhibited strong cross-reactivity with the pepsin-resistant polypeptides of type VI collagen. CLGP was also prepared in the unreduced disulfide-bonded form and in a partially reduced form, using brief treatment with cysteine. On treatment with pepsin these preparations yielded resistant peptides corresponding in size to the longer and shorter forms, respectively, of type VI collagen. A slightly larger, soluble form of CLGP (Mr = 150,000) was detected in the media from cultures of aortic smooth muscle cells and nuchal ligament fibroblasts. The evidence indicates that CLGP is the native form in which type VI collagen is present in the tissues and that it consists of three structurally distinct polypeptide chains, each about 140 kDa in mass, which are disulfide bonded into a triple-helical molecule. The CLGP molecules appear to be present in the tissues as dimers and larger aggregates, stabilized by intermolecular disulfide bonding. The distribution of type VI collagen will thus be as described in our earlier immunofluorescence studies with anti-CLGP antiserum (Gibson, M.A., and Cleary, E.G. (1983) Collagen Relat. Res. 3, 469-488).
Iron-Doped Carbon Nitride-Type Polymers as Homogeneous Organocatalysts for Visible Light-Driven Hydrogen Evolution	Graphitic carbon nitrides have appeared as a new type of photocatalyst for water splitting, but their broader and more practical applications are oftentimes hindered by the insolubility or difficult dispersion of the material in solvents. We herein prepared novel two-dimensional (2D) carbon nitride-type polymers doped by iron under a mild one-pot method through preorganizing formamide and citric acid precursors into supramolecular structures, which eventually polycondensed into a homogeneous organocatalyst for highly efficient visible light-driven hydrogen evolution with a rate of ∼16.2 mmol g(-1) h(-1) and a quantum efficiency of 0.8%. Laser photolysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic measurements suggested that iron-doping enabled strong electron coupling between the metal and the carbon nitride and formed unique electronic structures favoring electron mobilization along the 2D nanomaterial plane, which might facilitate the electron transfer process in the photocatalytic system and lead to efficient H2 evolution. In combination with electrochemical measurements, the electron transfer dynamics during water reduction were depicted, and the earth-abundant Fe-based catalyst may open a sustainable strategy for conversion of sunlight into hydrogen energy and cope with current challenging energy issues worldwide.
Scalable Photocatalyst Panels for Photoreforming of Plastic, Biomass and Mixed Waste in Flow	Solar-driven reforming uses sunlight and a photocatalyst to generate H2 fuel from waste at ambient temperature and pressure. However, it faces practical scaling challenges such as photocatalyst dispersion and recyclability, competing light absorption by the waste solution, slow reaction rates and low conversion yields. Here, the immobilisation of a noble-metal-free carbon nitride/nickel phosphide (CNx |Ni2 P) photocatalyst on textured glass is shown to overcome several of these limitations. The 1 cm2 CNx |Ni2 P panels photoreform plastic, biomass, food and mixed waste into H2 and organic molecules with rates comparable to those of photocatalyst slurries. Furthermore, the panels enable facile photocatalyst recycling and novel photoreactor configurations that prevent parasitic light absorption, thereby promoting H2 production from turbid waste solutions. Scalability is further verified by preparing 25 cm2 CNx |Ni2 P panels for use in a custom-designed flow reactor to generate up to 21 μmolH 22<math><msub><mrow></mrow> <msub><mrow></mrow> <mn>2</mn></msub> </msub> </math> m-2 h-1 under "real-world" (seawater, low sunlight) conditions. The application of inexpensive and readily scalable CNx |Ni2 P panels to photoreforming of a variety of real waste streams provides a crucial step towards the practical deployment of this technology.
Cost-effective and eco-friendly synthesis of novel and stable N-doped ZnO/g-C3N4 core-shell nanoplates with excellent visible-light responsive photocatalysis	N-doped ZnO/g-C3N4 hybrid core-shell nanoplates have been successfully prepared via a facile, cost-effective and eco-friendly ultrasonic dispersion method for the first time. HRTEM studies confirm the formation of the N-doped ZnO/g-C3N4 hybrid core-shell nanoplates with an average diameter of 50 nm and the g-C3N4 shell thickness can be tuned by varying the content of loaded g-C3N4. The direct contact of the N-doped ZnO surface and g-C3N4 shell without any adhesive interlayer introduced a new carbon energy level in the N-doped ZnO band gap and thereby effectively lowered the band gap energy. Consequently, the as-prepared hybrid core-shell nanoplates showed a greatly enhanced visible-light photocatalysis for the degradation of Rhodamine B compare to that of pure N-doped ZnO surface and g-C3N4. Based on the experimental results, a proposed mechanism for the N-doped ZnO/g-C3N4 photocatalyst was discussed. Interestingly, the hybrid core-shell nanoplates possess high photostability. The improved photocatalytic performance is due to a synergistic effect at the interface of the N-doped ZnO and g-C3N4 including large surface-exposure area, energy band structure and enhanced charge-separation properties. Significantly, the enhanced performance also demonstrates the importance of evaluating new core-shell composite photocatalysts with g-C3N4 as shell material.
Onco-fetal/laminin-binding collagen from colon carcinoma: detection of new sequences	We have recently identified an oncofetal-laminin binding collagen (OF/LB) composed of three alpha chains, with the apparent molecular mass of about 100 kDa each, but bearing different pI. One of the chains appears markedly acidic in a bidimensional electrophoretic system, where the NEPHGE is used as first dimension separating gel, while the two more basic chains have similar migration as alpha 1(III) and alpha 1(I) collagen chains, respectively. Sequence analyses have been performed on CNBr-peptides, derived from pepsinized triple helical molecules and on tryptic fragments obtained after in gel digestion of the acidic band. The research of sequence homology with computerized databases indicated that the acidic chain represents a gene product distinct from either type I, type III and other known collagen chains, while the identity of the other two chains remains to be fully determined.
Reduced-sized monolayer carbon nitride nanosheets for highly improved photoresponse for cell imaging and photocatalysis	Two-dimensional graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets (GCNNs) have been considered as an attractive metal-free semiconductor because of their superior catalytic, optical, and electronic properties. However, it is still challenging to prepare monolayer GCNNs with a reduced lateral size in nanoscale. Herein, a highly efficient ultrasonic technique was used to prepare nanosized monolayer graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (NMGCNs) with a thickness of around 0.6 nm and an average lateral size of about 55 nm. With a reduced lateral size yet monolayer thickness, NMGCNs show unique photo-responsive properties as compared to both large-sized GCNNs and GCN quantum dots. A dispersion of NMGCNs in water has good stability and exhibits strong blue fluorescence with a high quantum yield of 32%, showing good biocompatibility for cell imaging. Besides, compared to the multilayer GCNNs, NMGCNs show a highly improved photocatalysis under visible light irradiation. Overall, NMGCNs, characterized with monolayer and nanosized lateral dimension, fill the gap between large size (very high aspect ratio) and quantum dot-like counterparts, and show great potential applications as sensors, photo-related and electronic devices.
Carbon nitride supported Fe 2 cluster catalysts with superior performance for alkene epoxidation	Sub-nano metal clusters often exhibit unique and unexpected properties, which make them particularly attractive as catalysts. Herein, we report a "precursor-preselected" wet-chemistry strategy to synthesize highly dispersed Fe2 clusters that are supported on mesoporous carbon nitride (mpg-C3N4). The obtained Fe2/mpg-C3N4 sample exhibits superior catalytic performance for the epoxidation of trans-stilbene to trans-stilbene oxide, showing outstanding selectivity of 93% at high conversion of 91%. Molecular oxygen is the only oxidant and no aldehyde is used as co-reagent. Under the same condition, by contrast, iron porphyrin, single-atom Fe, and small Fe nanoparticles (ca. 3 nm) are nearly reactively inert. First-principles calculations reveal that the unique reactivity of the Fe2 clusters originates from the formation of active oxygen species. The general applicability of the synthesis approach is further demonstrated by producing other diatomic clusters like Pd2 and Ir2, which lays the foundation for discovering diatomic cluster catalysts.
Polymer Semiconductors for Artificial Photosynthesis: Hydrogen Evolution by Mesoporous Graphitic Carbon Nitride with Visible Light	We investigated semiconductor characteristics for polymeric carbon nitride as a metal-free photocatalyst working with visible light and have shown that the efficiency of hydrogen production by photochemical water reduction can be improved by similar to 1 order of magnitude by introducing the right type of mesoporosity into polymeric C3N4. We anticipate a wide rang of potential application of C3N4 as energy transducers for artificial photosynthesis in general, especially with a 3D continuous nanoarchitecture. Moreover, the results of finding photoactivity for carbon nitride nanoparticles can enrich the discussion on prebiotic chemistry of the Earth, as HCN polymer clusters are unequivocal in the solar system.
Superior visible light photocatalysis and low-operating temperature VOCs sensor using cubic Ag(0)-MoS2 loaded g-CN 3D porous hybrid	Two-dimensional materials are incipient as an innovative class of multifunctional elements with promising attributes for energy and environmental applications. Herein, a novel nanohybrid consisting of Ag-MoS2 loaded mesoporous g-C3N4 (herein 'm-CN') with ordered structure was synthesized by a nanocasting method using cubic and ordered mesoporous silica (KIT-6) as a hard template. Due to its unique 3D mesoporous architecture, the as-synthesized Ag-MoS2 @m-CN nanohybrid revealed excellent visible-light absorption for enhanced charge separation of photo-induced e(-)-h(+) pairs to improve the degradation performance, high stability, and reusability with respect to Rhodamine B (RhB). The measured very high degradation efficiency is explained by synergistic effects from catalytically active Ag and MoS2 nanoparticles cumulatively decorated on the cubic mesoporous m-CN in form 3D mesoporous architecture. Additionally, the Ag-MoS2@m-CN nanohybrid exhibits high response and selectivity toward n-butanol gas at low-operating temperatures for reliable detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The photocatalysis behavior and VOC sensing response of Ag-MoS2@m-CN nanohybrid material are discussed in detail for possible various application avenues toward environmental purifications and monitoring.

Controlled preparation of P-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production	Hydrogen production by photolysis of water by sunlight is an environmentally-friendly preparation technology for renewable energy. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), despite with obvious catalytic effect, is still unsatisfactory for hydrogen production. In this work, phosphorus element is incorporated to tune g-C3N4's property through calcinating the mixture of g-C3N4 and NaH2PO2, sacrificial agent and co-catalyst also been supplied to help efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production. Phosphorus (P) doped g-C3N4 samples (PCN-S) were prepared, and their catalytic properties were studied. X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and ultraviolet diffuse reflection (UV-DRS) were used to study their structures and morphologies. The results show that the reaction rate of PCN-S is 318 mu rnol.h(-1).g(-1) which is 2.98 times as high as pure carbon nitride nanosheets (CN) can do. Our study paves a new avenue, which is simple, environment-friendly and sustainable, to synthesize highly efficient P doping g-C3N4 nanosheets for solar energy conversion.

Construction of Functionally Compartmental Inorganic Photocatalyst-Enzyme System via Imitating Chloroplast for Efficient Photoreduction of CO 2 to Formic Acid	Inorganic photocatalyst-enzyme systems are a prominent platform for the photoreduction of CO2 to value-added chemicals and fuels. However, poor electron transfer kinetics and enzyme deactivation by reactive oxygen species in the photoexcitation process severely limit catalytic efficiency. In chloroplast, enzymatic CO2 reduction and photoexcitation are compartmentalized by the thylakoid membrane, which protects enzymes from photodamage, while the tightly integrated photosystem facilitates electron transfer, promoting photocatalysis. By mimicking this strategy, we constructed a novel functionally compartmental inorganic photocatalyst-enzyme system for CO2 reduction to formate. To accomplish efficient electron transfer, we first synthesized an integrated artificial photosystem by conjugation of the cocatalyst (a Rh complex) onto thiophene-modified C3N4 (TPE-C3N4), demonstrating an NADH regeneration rate of 9.33 μM·min-1, 2.33 times higher than that of a homogeneous counterpart. The enhanced NADH regeneration activity was caused by the tightly conjugated structure of the artificial photosystem, enabling rapid electron transfer from TPE-C3N4 to the Rh complex. To protect formate dehydrogenase (FDH) from photoinduced deactivation, FDH was encapsulated into MAF-7, a metal-organic framework (MOF) material, to compartmentalize FDH from the toxic photoexcitation process, similar to the function of the thylakoid membrane. Moreover, the triazole linkers of MAF-7 possess both hydrophilicity and pH-buffering capacity providing a stable microenvironment for FDH, which could enhance enzyme stability in photosynthesis. The synergy between the enhanced electron transfer of TPE-C3N4 for NADH cofactor regeneration and MOF-protection of the redox enzyme enables the construction of a functionally compartmental inorganic photocatalyst-enzyme association system, promoting CO2 photoconversion to formic acid with a yield of 16.75 mM after 9 h of illumination, 3.24 times greater than that of the homogeneous reaction counterpart.
Immunological determination of the order of folding of portions of the molecule during air oxidation of reduced ribonuclease	An immunological method is used to follow the folding of different portions of the reduced bovine pancreatic ribonuclease molecule during air oxidation. Antibodies that react specifically with segments 1-13, 31-79, and 80-124 of native ribonuclease, as they are folded, were purified by affinity chromatography, using antiserum to native ribonuclease and columns to which the ribonuclease fragments were attached. The kinetics of reaction between these prufied antibodies and refolded portions that are produced when reduced rebonuclease is oxidized by air demonstrate the presence of intermediate states of folding, and are consistent with folding of the anti-genic determinants in the order 80-124, 1-13, and 31-79. The relative stabilities of each of these segments to thermal denaturation in the native protein provide additional evidence that the native conformation of region 80-124 is a very stable one in the intact molecule. On the basis of these two types of evidence, it appears that segment 80-124 contains a nucleation site for the folding of the protein molecule.
XRD and IR revelation of a unique g-C3N4 phase with effects on collagen/hydroxyapatite bone scaffold pore geometry and stiffness	Pore geometry (pore size and pore interconnectivity) and stiffness are important design requirements for 3D-scaffold fabrication. The required pore geometry allows the passage of growth factors for cell proliferation and removal of waste products, whereas the stiffness influences attachment of osteogenic cells. This work fabricates a 3D scaffold from collagen (Col) and snail shell hydroxyapatite (HApS) and examines the influence of the HApS on the scaffold pore geometry and stiffness. The scaffolds were fabricated using freeze-drying method. Col alone and Col-commercial hydroxyapatite (Col-HApC) scaffolds were used as controls. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) reveals well-interconnected pores for Col-HApS with a mean pore size of 246.9 +/- 68.7 mu m, which was statistically (p < 0.05) same as that of Col scaffolds 224.4 +/- 85.7 mu m and different (p < 0.05) from Col-HApC scaffolds 125.5 +/- 26.7 mu m. Mechanical testing showed a stiffness of 20.8 +/- 0.4 kPa, 181.2 +/- 11.8 kPa, and 206.9 +/- 14.1 kPa for Col, Col-HApC, and Col-HApS, respectively. Uniquely, X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and Infrared (IR) spectroscopy of Col-HApS revealed phases and functional groups that were comparable to graphitic-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4) polymeric structure. It was found that the structural change was responsible for the well-interconnected large pores and high stiffness of the scaffold. It is expected that the effect brings a wide range of functions (such as better cell attachment and nutrient transport) in the scaffold for osteogenesis. The findings indicate that Col-HApS scaffolds would promote osteogenic cell response more usefully than Col-HApC or Col scaffolds.[GRAPHICS].
The Improvement of Photocatalysis H-2 Evolution Over g-C3N4 With Na and Cyano-Group Co-modification	Na and cyano-group co-modified g-C3N4 was easily synthesized and its physicochemical property was completely analyzed. The results manifested that Na and cyano-group modification could heighten visible light absorbed ability and accelerate photoinduced charge separation. When resultant Na and cyano-group co-modified g-C3N4 was splitting water H-2 evolution, its H-2 evolution rate was obviously improved. Furthermore, it also kept excellent stable capacity of H-2 evolution and stability of chemical structure. Hence, this present study does not only develop an efficient strategy to boost photocatalytic property of g-C3N4 based catalysts, but also provides useful guidance for designing more effective photocatalysts.
Growth and characterization of self-assembled carbon nitride leaf-like nanostructures	Carbon nitride nanostructures have been created using the novel technique of liquid phase pulsed laser ablation of a graphite target in ammonia solution. For ablation times between 1 and 7 h, 'leaf-shaped' nanostructures are formed by self-assembly of carbon nitride nanorods. With increasing ablation time, the crystallinity of the nanorod building blocks improves, and the length of the nanoleaf structures increases while the width remains constant. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results confirmed that nitrogen is chemically incorporated into the carbon network. The N-C (sp(2)) bonding increases with increasing ablation time, whereas the N-C (sp) and N-C (sp(3)) bonding behaviour is more complex. The optical properties for these leaf-like structures as a function of ablation time are also discussed.
Step-scheme WO3/CdIn2S4 hybrid system with high visible light activity for tetracycline hydrochloride photodegradation	Photocatalytic degradation is an ideal choice for the treatment of antibiotic contaminant in water environment because of the characters of environmental-benign and sustainable. In this work, the visible-light-driven WO3/CdIn2S4 hybrid photocatalysts with different WO3 content were successfully fabricated by hydrothermal method. The phase structure, surface composition, optical properties, specific surface areas and charge separation were systematically by a series of measurements. The photocatalytic activity of resultant WO3/CdIn2S4 hybrid photocatalysts was evaluated by photocatalytic degradation for removal of tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH) and the results reveal that optimized photocatalytic efficiency in WO3/CdIn(2)S(4)hybrid photocatalysts can be achieved by modulating the weight ratio of WO3/CdIn2S4. The 70 wt% WO3/CdIn2S4 hybrid photocatalyst exhibited the best photodegradation activity. Significant enhancement of photocatalytic activity in WO3/CdIn2S4 hybrid photocatalysts is ascribed to effective charge separation due to the construction of step-scheme heterojunction. The photocatalytic mechanism involving charge transfer and separation, and degradation path using stepscheme WO3/CdIn2S4 hybrid photocatalysts were in-depth investigated and discussed. It is anticipated that our current investigation could open an avenue for design and preparation of step-scheme hybrid photocatalysts for environmental remediation.
Facile fabrication of mesoporous g-C3N4/TiO2 photocatalyst for efficient degradation of DNBP under visible light irradiation	In this paper, a novel thermal condensation method was developed for preparing mesoporous g-C3N4/TiO2 composite by using PAA-Ti/TiO2 and melamine as co-precursors. This method can not only ensure the incorporation of TiO2 nanoparticles into g-C3N4 matrix but also lead to the formation of mesoporous structures. In the heating process, polyacrylate (PAA) in the PAA-Ti/TiO2 composites can volatilizeto produce carbonous gases and its volatilization temperature falls into the temperature range formelamine condensation, which makes PAA-Ti/TiO2 a suitable pore-forming agent for fabricating mesoporous g-C3N4/TiO2. The largest surface area for the fabricated mesoporous g-C3N4/TiO2 was found to be 268 m(2)g(-1), which was approximately 7 or 12 times higher than that of TiO2 or g-C3N4. The mesoporous g-C3N4/TiO2 composite exhibited excellent reproducibility and good performance in the photocatalytic decomposition of dinitro butyl phenol (DNBP) under visible-light illumination. The enhanced photocatalytic efficiency can be attributed to the synergetic effects of large surface area and the formation of heterojunction interface between g-C3N4 and TiO2. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Ultrasmall C-TiO2-X nanoparticle/g-C3N4 composite for CO2 photoreduction with high efficiency and selectivity	The photoreduction of CO2 to CO offers a promising sustainable and clean approach for a global new energy program. Coupling this reductive process with a matched water photo-oxidation pathway is an attractive avenue to accelerate the half-reaction of CO2 reduction. Herein, we propose a three-component photocatalyst design strategy for reducing CO2 to CO coupled with water oxidation via a two-electron/two-step pathway. Employing polyoxotitanium ([Ti17O24(OPri)(20)]) as a titanium source, ultrasmall TiO2-x nanoparticles coated with ultrathin carbon layers (C-TiO2-x) were fabricated and loaded on to a g-C3N4 matrix through chemical bonding (C-TiO2-x@g-C3N4) for the first time. The optimized C-TiO2-x@g-C3N4 photocatalyst showed a very high activity of 12.30 mmol g(-1) (204.96 mmol g(TiO2)(-1)) CO generation within 60 h visible-light irradiation, which represents the highest CO production rate to date among the reported TiO2-based materials under similar conditions. The excellent adsorption capability of C-TiO2-x@g-C3N4 for photons, H+ protons, and CO2 molecules together with efficient charge separation and the two-electron/two-step oxidative pathway lead to the high reactivity.
Influence of the voltage window on resistive switching memory characteristics based on g-C3N4 device	The resistance change of an insulator or semiconductor under applied current or voltage is defined as resistive switching effect, which is a significative physical performance in the exploit of new concept nonvolatile resistance random access memory (ARAM). In our work, the g-C3N4 powder was firstly fabricated by calcination method, and continuously a device with Ag/g-C3N4/FTO structure was prepared using drop-coated g-C3N4 powder to form a film onto FTO. It can be observed that the as prepared cell exhibits an excellent resistive switching memory characteristic (HRS/LRS resistance ratio can be reached to similar to 52) and good reliability under applied voltage window of 4.0 V. Finally, it is believed that the space charge limited conduction is appropriate to understanding such the memory behavior.
In-situ fabrication of Z-scheme Bi3O4Cl/Bi12O17Cl2 heterostructure by facile pH control strategy to boost removal of various pollutants in water	It is highly desirable to develop an in-situ fabrication route by facile pH control strategy to prepare Z-scheme heterostructure photocatalyst for producing more firm and intimate interfacial interaction, which will be in favor of removing pollutants in water under the visible light. Herein, the new highly-efficient visible-light-driven Z-scheme Bi3O4Cl/Bi12O17Cl2 heterostructure is prepared by in-situ growth method and this research explores a novel pathway to interconvert Bi12O17Cl2 and Bi3O4Cl by facile pH control strategy. The Z-scheme Bi3O4Cl/Bi12O17Cl2 heterostructure exhibits splendid universal photocatalytic degradation activities to degrade various pollutants under visible light irradiation. The Z-scheme heterostructure and the strong interfacial coupling effect produced by in-situ growth of Bi3O4Cl on the surface of Bi12O17Cl2 are the main reasons to enhance photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the possible photocatalytic reaction mechanisms including migration and transport behaviors of charge carriers, generation process of reactive species and degradation intermediate products of 2, 4-dichlorophenol are revealed in depth. This proposes a novel design concept to prepare highlyefficient, stable and visible-light-driven Z-scheme photocatalyst, which is expected to be widely applied for the universal removal of multiple pollutants in wastewater efficiently.
Scalable one-step template-free synthesis of ultralight edge-functionalized g-C3N4 nanosheets with enhanced visible light photocatalytic performance	Herein, we report a scalable, green and "bottom-up" approach for the synthesis of ultralight g-C3N4 nanosheets. The ultralight g-C3N4 nanosheets (9.6 mg cm(-3)) have been entirely synthesized in a wet atmosphere in one step without pretreatment or any other additives. The as-prepared material (UMCN-wet) appears as a foam-like exterior with ultrathin nanosheets (3.5 nm), short-order polymerization and sharp edges. The X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses confirm the formation of melon units with edge-enriched active sites. UMCN-wet exhibits a higher specific surface area (137.44 m(2) g(-1)) and pore volume (0.2076 cm(3) g(-1)), compared with that of the as-synthesized materials in the air (MCN-air) and nitrogen (MCN-N-2) atmospheres. The optical and electrochemical analyses reveal that UMCN-wet manifests fast photogenerated charge separation and transfer with slow decay kinetics. As a result, UMCN-wet nanosheets exhibit superb photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B (RhB), methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) under visible light irradiation with photodegradation rate constant (k) of 0.17687, 0.02409 and 0.00537 min(-1), respectively. Moreover, UMCN-wet exhibits excellent stability and reusability performance. Such a sustainable approach does not only overcome the prolonged time processing, extra energy consumption and utilization of hazardous chemicals for synthesis ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets, but also paves a new pathway for industrial upscale production with numerous expected environmental applications.
Layered by layered Ni-Mn-LDH/g-C3N4 nanohybrid for multi-purpose photo/electrocatalysis: Morphology controlled strategy for effective charge carriers separation	The earth copious extremely active photo/electrocatalysts have been of immense interest for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) together with environment purification. However, the efficiency of photo/electrocatalysis is still low because of the less visible light absorption and fast recombination of electron-hole pairs. Herein taking the benefits of layered and electronic structural design of Ni-Mn-layered double hydroxide and layered graphitic carbon nitride. A novel Ni-Mn-LDH/g-C3N4 heterostructured photo/electrocatalyst with suited bands was in situ constructed by temperature controlled hydrothermal treatment. A turn in band gap energy within the range of Ni-Mn-LDH to g-C3N4 was noted through a series of physicochemical techniques. Consequently the optimized nanohybrid Ni-Mn-LDH/g-C3N4 (10%) used as best electrocatalyst with J(OER) = 10 mAcm(-2) @ 316 mV and J(HER) = -60 mAcm(-2) @ 147 mV). Furthermore under visible light illumination it function as outperformed photo/electrocatalyst with J(OER) = 10 mAcm(-2) @ 296 mV and J(HER) = -60 mAcm(-2) @ -126 mV in 1 M KOH with a super stability. Similarly it was used for the degradation of RhB with outperformance (>= 99%) and rate constant k = 0.313 mn(-1). Rivaling the performance of expensive catalysts such as RuO2 and Pt/C and other counterparts. The enhanced photo/electrocatalytic activity ascribed to the formation of band-matched layered by layered heterojunction-accelerated charge separation. It is predicted that our temperature controlled strategy based on earth-profuse elements with structural reliability providing an innovative and inexpensive photo/electrocatalytic system for realistic energy conversion applications.
Enhanced photocatalytic activity of AgNPs-in-CNTs with hydrogen peroxide under visible light irradiation	Silver nanoparticles in carbon nanotubes (AgNPs-in-CNTs) were prepared through a simple thermal decomposition method. Synthesized AgNPs-in-CNTs were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), AgNPs-in-CNTs exhibited perfect photocatalytic activity in rhodamine B (RhB) degradation under visible light irradiation. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration and initial pH values were comprehensively scrutinized. When the concentration of H2O2 was 20 mM, about 99.8% RhB (20 mg L-1) could be degraded within 50 min while the initial pH (3-10) values had a negligible effect on the degradation. From the investigations of Raman spectroscopy, transient photocurrent responses, photoluminescence, and radical quenching experiments, the findings suggest that under light irradiation, AgNPs-in-CNTs can absorb photons and generate photogenerated electrons through localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect, the photogenerated electrons react with H2O2 to produce center dot OH radicals for decomposing RhB.
Facile synthesis of few-layer-thick carbon nitride nanosheets by liquid ammonia-assisted lithiation method and their photocatalytic redox properties	High-quality few-layer-thick graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets (NSs) were fabricated by a simple, highly efficient, and rapid method namely, liquid ammonia (LA)-assisted lithiation. Li intercalation occurred in less than half an hour, importantly, the degree of Li intercalation was indicated by the color change of LA solution from deep blue to colorless. The obtained products were carefully investigated by field-emission transmission electron microscopy, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman scattering spectrometry, UV-visible absorption spectrometry, photoluminescence, soft X-ray absorption and nonresonant soft X-ray emission spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption near-edge structure analyses. Because of the lack of high-temperature or high-energy treatment, high-yield few-layer-thick g-C3N4 NSs were produced with trace O-2 impurity. Interestingly, while maintaining the similar crystal structure and chemical stoichiometric ratio relative to the parent bulk materials, the surface structure, electronic and optical properties were significantly varied. Moreover, compared to the bulk counterparts, the as-prepared g-C3N4 NSs show clearly enhanced photocatalytic redox activity with respect to both photocatalytic H-2 evolution and hydroxyl radical generation. LA-assisted lithiation is a general method and could be easily extended to exfoliate diverse other layered materials such as molybdenum and tungsten sulfides.

Energy Band Engineering of Polymeric Carbon Nitride with Indium Doping for High Enhancement in Charge Separation and Photocatalytic Performance	Metal doping is a valid strategy to increase simultaneously photoabsorption, the charge separation efficiency, and thus the photocatalytic activity of polymeric carbon nitride (CN); however, metal elements in groups IIIA-VA in the periodic table are rarely researched in doping CN. Herein, indium (In)-doped CN (In:CN) was first synthesized with In3+ ions inserted in the interlayer, approaching the cavities in the monolayer sheets, and fixed through coordination with nitrogen atoms around them. In:CN exhibits a higher photoabsorption, specific surface area, charge separation and transfer efficiency, and photocatalytic performance in H-2 generation and environmental remediation than bulky CN. The H-2 generation and rhodamine B decomposition rates for In:CN are similar to 2.9 and 4.6 times those for CN, respectively. The apparent quantum yield (420 nm) of In:CN for H-2 production can reach 6.8%. The enhancement in charge separation plays an indispensable role for the photoactivity increase of In:CN, which originates from the generation of an impurity level above the valence band edge in the bandgap because of the In doping, i.e., the In3+-coordination structure works as a hole-capture center. This paper supplies an easy method for CN modification and illustrates the mechanism for In-doping-induced change of the energy band structure, which may guide the preparation of other CN-based photocatalysts with metal doping.
Isopropanol-assisted synthesis of highly stable MAPbBr(3)/p-g-C3N4 intergrowth composite photocatalysts and their interfacial charge carrier dynamics	Two phase photocatalysts can be intergrown with each other, resulting in superior photocatalytic properties. Herein, methylamine lead bromide (MAPbBr(3)) wrapped/entrapped protonated graphitic carbon nitride (p-g-C3N4) intergrowth microcrystals were fabricated by mixing a pervoskite precursor with p-g-C3N4 colloidal sol. A highly stable isopropanol (IPA) solvent based photocatalytic system for dye degradation was demonstrated. The composite with an optimal p-g-C3N4 mass percentage of 3.3 wt% (denoted as MAPbBr(3)/p-g-C3N4-1.0 mg) exhibited the highest photocatalytic degradation of malachite green (99.8%) within 10 min under visible light, which was 5.3-fold and 16-fold greater than that exhibited by its constituents separately. The strong chemical interaction and fundamental photophysical processes in MAPbBr(3)/p-g-C3N4 were systematically evaluated by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques, confirming the effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and faster interfacial charge transfer behavior. Furthermore, active superoxide radicals (O-2(-)) played a vital role in the catalytic reaction, because of the significant photoinduced electron transfer rate (k(et)) in the inverted type-I core/shell MAPbBr(3)/p-g-C3N4 band configuration structure. In addition, MAPbBr(3)/p-g-C3N4 has good cycling stability for 10 cycles and versatility for other cationic (RhB) and anionic (MO) dye pollutants, indicating the great potential for solar energy conversion into chemical energy.
Graphitic Carbon Nitride Nanosheets-Based Ratiometric Fluorescent Probe for Highly Sensitive Detection of H2O2 and Glucose	Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets, an emerging graphene-like carbon-based nanomaterial with high fluorescence and large specific surface areas, hold great potential for biosensor applications. Current g-C3N4 nanosheets based fluorescent biosensors majorly rely on single fluorescent intensity reading through fluorescence quenching interactions between the nanosheets and metal ions. Here we report for the first time the development of a novel g-C3N4 nanosheets-based ratiometric fluorescence sensing strategy for highly sensitive detection of H2O2 and glucose. With o-phenylenediamine (OPD) oxidized by H2O2 in the presence of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), the oxidization product can assemble on the g-C(3)N4 nanosheets through hydrogen bonding and pi-pi stacking, which effectively quenches the fluorescence of g-C3N4 while delivering a new emission peak. The ratiometric signal variations enable robust and sensitive detection of H2O2. On the basis of the glucose converting into H2O2 through the catalysis of glucose oxidase, the g-C3N4-based ratiometric fluorescence sensing platform is also exploited for glucose assay. The developed strategy is demonstrated to give a detection limit of 50 nM for H2O2 and 0.4 mu M for glucose, at the same time, it has been successfully used for glucose levels detection in human serum. This strategy may provide a cost-efficient, robust, and high-throughput platform for detecting various species involving H2O2-generation reactions for biomedical applications.
Ionic Carbon Nitrides in Solar Hydrogen Production and Organic Synthesis: Exciting Chemistry and Economic Advantages	Molecular photoredox complexes from the platinum group paved the way of organic photocatalysis. However, high price and difficulties related to removal and recycling hamper application of such complexes on the larger scale. Carbon nitride semiconductor photocatalysts are deprived at large extent of such limitations. Herein, we summarize application of ionic carbon nitrides in photocatalysis. A salt-like structure of ionic carbon nitrides comprising negatively charged poly(heptazine imide) anion and positively charged alkali metal cations gives rise to a number of unique properties and high activity in photocatalysis. The performance of ionic carbon nitrides in H-2 generation is up to 100 times higher compared with the covalent graphitic carbon nitrides. Eleven photocatalytic reactions mediated by ionic carbon nitrides and their long-lived radicals are reviewed. Economy of using carbon nitride photocatalysts in comparison with the photoredox complexes from the platinum group has been analyzed.

Fragments of rabbit striated muscle alpha-tropomyosin. II. Binding to troponin-T	The interactions of a variety of large fragments of rabbit skeletal muscle alpha-tropomyosin, prepared as previously described, with troponin-T and a soluble tropomyosin-binding fragment of troponin-T (CB1) have been investigated by affinity chromatography and gel filtration. No specific interactions between NH2-terminal fragments encompassing residues 1-189 with troponin, troponin-T, or CB1 immobilized on a Sephadex 4B column could be demonstrated. Similarly, there was no interaction between these fragments and CB1 on a gel filtration column operated in 0.1 M KCl, 10 mM imidazole pH 7.0 buffer. On the other hand, all fragments encompassing residues 190-284 showed interaction with troponin-T on the affinity column and with CB1 by gel filtration. When mixtures of two fragments, one of which had the intact NH2-terminal sequence of the original tropomyosin structure and the other the intact COOH-terminal sequence, were applied to the gel filtration column, there was no indication of interaction between them. However, when CB1 was included in the mixture, a ternary complex of the three components was demonstrable. Fragments in which 10 or 12 residues at the NH2-terminal end of the alpha-tropomyosin sequence were absent showed no evidence of forming a ternary complex with CB1 and the COOH-terminal fragments. We conclude that the binding of the troponin-T fragment, CB1, to the COOH-terminal third of the alpha-tropomyosin molecule enhances head-to-tail aggregation of tropomyosin molecules either indirectly by the transmission of conformational changes to the head-to-tail overlap region or more directly by binding close to or at this region.
Co Nanoparticles/Co, N, S Tri-doped Graphene Templated from In Situ -Formed Co, S Co-doped g-C3N4 as an Active Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Overall Water Splitting	The development of high-performance electrocatalyst with earth abundant elements for water-splitting is a key factor to improve its cost efficiency. Herein, a noble metal-free bifunctional electrocatalyst was synthesized by a facile pyrolysis method using sucrose, urea, Co(NO3)(2) and sulfur powder as raw materials. During the fabrication process, Co, S co-doped graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was first produced, and then this in-situ-formed template further induced the generation of a Co, N, S tri-doped graphene coupled with Co nanoparticles (NPs) in the following pyrolysis process. The effect of pyrolysis temperature (700, 800, and 900 degrees C) on the physical properties and electrochemical performances of the final product was studied. Thanks to the increased number of graphene layer encapsulated Co NPs, higher graphitization degree of carbon matrix and the existence of hierarchical macro/meso pores, the composite electrocatalyst prepared under 900 degrees C presented the best activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with outstanding long-term durability. This work presented a facile method for the fabrication of non-noble-metal-based composite from in-situ-formed template and also demonstrated a potential bifunctional electrocatalyst for the future investigation and application.
Copper iodide decorated graphitic carbon nitride sheets with enhanced visible-light response for photocatalytic organic pollutant removal and antibacterial activities	The photocatalytic process is an environmentally-friendly procedure that has been well known in the destruction of organic pollutants in water. The multiple semiconductor heterojunctions are broadly applied to enhance the photocatalytic performances in comparison to the single semiconductor. Polymeric semiconductors have received much attention as inspiring candidates owing to their adjustable optical absorption features and simply adaptable electronic structure. The shortcomings of the current photocatalytic system, which restricts their technical applications incorporate fast charge recombination, low-utilization of visible radiation, and low immigration capability of the photo-induced electron-hole. This paper indicates the novel fabrication of new CuI/g-C3N4 nanocomposite by hydrothermal and ultrasound-assisted co-precipitation methods. The structure, shape, and purity of the products were affected by different weight percentages and fabrication processes. Electron microscope unveils that CuI nanoparticles are distributed on g-C3N4. The bandgap of pure carbon nitride is estimated at 2.70 eV, and the bandgap of the nanocomposite has increased to 2.8 eV via expanding the amount of CuI. The CuI/C3N4 nanocomposite has a great potential to degrade cationic and anionic dyes in high value because of its appropriate bandgap. It can be a great catalyst for water purification. The photocatalytic efficiency is affected by multiple factors such as types of dyes, fabrication methods, the light sources, mass ratios, and scavengers. The fabricated CuI/C3N4 nanocomposite exposes higher photocatalytic performance than the pure C3N4 and CuI. The photocatalytic efficiency of nanocomposite is enhanced by enhancing the amount of CuI. Besides, the fabricated CuI/C3N4 revealed remarkable reusability without the obvious loss of photocatalytic activity. The antibacterial activity of the specimens reveals that the highest antimicrobial activities are revealed against P. aeruginosa and E. coli. These results prove that the nanocomposite possesses high potential for killing bacteria, and it can be nominated as a suitable agent against bacteria.
Temperature-Controlled Selectivity of Hydrogenation and Hydrodeoxygenation in the Conversion of Biomass Molecule by the Ru 1/mpg-C3N4 Catalyst	Hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation are significant and distinct approaches for the conversion of biomass and biomass-derived oxygenated chemicals into high value-added chemicals and fuels. However, it remains a great challenge to synthesize catalysts that simultaneously possess excellent hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation performance. Herein, we report a catalyst made of isolated single-atom Ru supported on mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (Ru1/mpg-C3N4), fabricated by a wet impregnation method. The as-prepared Ru1/mpg-C3N4 catalyst shows excellent hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation performance. First-principles calculations reveal that the Ru atom is mobilized, and the active site is induced by adsorption of the reactants. A systematic reaction mechanism is proposed, suggesting that vanillyl alcohol is the deoxygenation prohibited product, while 2-methoxy- p-cresol is the deoxygenation allowed product. Thus, the excellent selectivity for the hydrogenation or hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin at different temperatures results from switching between the two types of products.
NaBH4-treated cobalt-doped g-C3N4 for enhanced activation of peroxymonosulfate	Cobalt-doped g-C3N4 exhibited good peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation for removing the organic compounds. However, the contact of PMS with cobalt-doped g-C3N4 was inhibited at neutral pH due to electrostatic repulsion. In this work, cobalt-doped g-C3N4 was treated with NaBH4 solution. The physicochemical properties of the treated cobalt-doped g-C3N4 were characterized by several techniques. Obtained results showed the changes in specific surface area and zeta potential. In the catalytic experiment, the treated cobalt-doped g-C3N4 showed an excellent activation of PMS to degrade Acid Orange 7. The significantly enhanced PMS activation was due to the effective contact between PMS and the treated Co-doped g-C3N4 via electrostatic attraction. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Synergistic effects of multiple heterojunctions significantly enhance the photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate CdS/La2Ti2O7/NiS2 ternary composites	Novel CdS/La2Ti2O7/NiS2 ternary composite photocatalysts without noble metal were successfully constructed by a simple hydrothermal method. Under visible light irradiation (lambda> 400 nm), the optimal CdS/La2Ti2O2/NiS2 composite produced H-2 at a rate of about 12.77 mmol g(-1) h(-1), which was 84 times as high as that of pure CdS. This performance enhancement can be attributed to the formation of multiple heterojunctions (including CdS/NiS2, CdS/La2Ti2O7 and CdS/La2Ti2O2/NiS2 interface structures) between the three components in the as-prepared CdS/La2Ti2O2/NiS2 composites. The formed multiple heterojunctions help to separate electron-hole pairs more quickly and efficiently, thus greatly increasing the photocatalytic activity of the CdS/La2Ti2O2/NiS2 composites. This is very important for the utlization of solar energy for water splitting. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.
Construction of BiOCOOH/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst and its enhanced visible light photocatalytic degradation of amido black 10B	The application of semiconductor photocatalysts in wastewater treatment has received increasingly attentions because of its potential utilization of solar energy. In this study, a novel visible-light-driven (VLD) BiOCOOH/gC3N4 composite photocatalyst was successful synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. Afterwards, physicochemical properties of the resulting samples were investigated through X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas, UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS), transient photocurrent density, Mott-Schottky (M - S) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement. Furthermore, the visible light photocatalytic (PC) performance was evaluated through the degradation of amido black 10B dye. All results indicated that the combination of g-C3N4 and BiOCOOH could exhibited greatly visible light absorbance and photo-generated charge separation efficiency, thereby resulting in the enhanced PC performance of BiOCOOH/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst. The optimal Bi/C molar rate in BiOCOOH/g-C3N4 composite was determined to be 1/1, and the corresponding photodegradation rate for amido black 10B was 0.01794 min(-1), which was nearly 2.19 and 5.73 folds higher than that of pure g-C3N4 and BiOCOOH. The possible mechanism of the PC reaction was also discussed in detail. Furthermore, BiOCOOH/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst performed good reusability and stability even after four recycle utilization.
Enhanced Photocatalytic Activities of RhB Degradation and H-2 Evolution from in Situ Formation of the Electrostatic Heterostructure MoS2/NiFe LDH Nanocomposite through the Z-Scheme Mechanism via p-n Heterojunctions	Designing of an efficient heterostructure photocatalyst for photocatalytic organic pollutant removal and H-2 production has been a subject of rigorous research intended to solve the related environmental aggravation and enormous energy crises. Z-scheme-based charge-transfer dynamics in a p-n heterostructure could significantly replicate the inherent power of natural photosynthesis, which is the key point to affect the transportation of photoinduced exciton pairs. In this finding, a series of p-type MoS2 loaded with n-type NiFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH) forming a heterostructure MoS2/NiFe LDH were designed by electrostatic self-assembled chemistry and an in situ hydrothermal strategy for photocatalytic rhodamine B (RhB) dye degradation and H-2 production. The creation of p-n heterojunctions of type-II and Z-scheme mode of charge transfer modified the optical and electronic property of the as-synthesized MSLDH3, thereafter promoting the generation, separation, and migration of photoinduced electron-hole pairs. The as-synthesized MSLDH3 showed superior photocatalytic activities in degradation of RhB with H-2 evolution, which was enhanced by 3- and 4.5-fold and 10.9 and 19.2 times higher than that of NiFe LDH and MoS2, respectively. Last but not the least, heterostructure MSLDH3 possesses practical stability for its resultant enhanced photocatalytic activity with recyclability for everyday life.
In situ co-precipitation for the synthesis of an Ag/AgBr/Bi5O7I heterojunction for enhanced visible-light photocatalysis	An Ag/AgBr/Bi5O7I heterojunction was developed using a simple in situ co-precipitation method. Ag/AgBr nanoparticles were tightly bound to Bi5O7I, improving charge transfer at the heterojunction interface. The photocatalytic activities of the Ag/AgBr/Bi5O7I composites were studied by monitoring the photodegradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and through the generation of a transient photocurrent under visible-light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm). The Ag/AgBr/Bi5O7I composites displayed enhanced photocatalytic activities compared to either pure Ag/AgBr or Bi5O7I. Charge carrier behavior was investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) which indicated the enhanced separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes, thus giving to the higher photocatalytic activity. The high-performance semiconductor heterojunction developed in this work is a good candidate for photocatalytic application. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Aptamer-based photoelectrochemical assay for the determination of MCF-7	In this work, an aptamer-based photoelectrochemical (PEC) assay is reported for the determination of MCF-7 breast cancer cells using hexagonal carbon nitride tubes (HCNTs) as photoactive material. The aptamer immobilized on the HCNT surface can specifically bind with mucin 1 protein (MUC1) that is overexpressed on the surface of MCF-7 cell. Thus, the PEC assay has high specificity for the determination of MCF-7. The determination of MCF-7 is due to the binding of MCF-7 onto HCNT that suppressed the photocurrent intensity. The PEC assay displays good performances for MCF-7 determination with a linear range from 1 × 102 to 1 × 105 cell mL-1 and limit of detection down to 17 cells mL-1. Meanwhile, the PEC assay can distinguish MCF-7 from normal cells in blood samples, which may have potential applications in cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.
Facile Route to Prepare TaC, NbC and WC Nanoparticles	By a novel solid-state reaction process using amorphous C3N4(a-C3N4) and transition metal oxides as starting reagents, Cubic TaC, NbC and hexagonal WC nanoparticles were successfully synthesized at 1150 degrees C. The products were characterized by power X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). The experimental results show that a-C3N4 obtained by the reaction between C3N3Cl3 and Li3N is a highly efficient carburation reagent and the transition metal oxides are completely transformed into the corresponding metal carbide nanoparticles at 1150 degrees C, respectively, which is significantly lower than that reported for the traditional preparation of carbides, typically > 1600 degrees C. The TaC, NbC and WC nanoparticles are found to have an average particle size of 10 nm, 15 nm and 8 nm by TEM observation, respectively.
Nitrogen vacancies modified graphitic carbon nitride: Scalable and one-step fabrication with efficient visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution	Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with nitrogen vacancies (CN-x) was fabricated by a straightforward one-step N2H4 center dot H2O-assisted thermal polymerization method, avoiding high-energy consumption and complex posttreatment. 100-fold precursor amplification experiment proved that such a simple one-step method could achieve scalable synthesis. Experiment results show that nitrogen vacancies, introduced into CN-x architecture by removing N atoms in the C-containing triazine rings (C=N-C) (N-2C ) sites, cause bandgap narrowing and generate downward-shifted midgap states under the conduction band (CB) edge, which consequently extend the visible-light absorption and inhibit recombination of electrons and holes. As a result, under optimal amount of N2H4 center dot H2O added, CN-75 shows a highest H-2 evolution rate of 8171.4 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1) and 3895.1 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1) under lambda > 420 nm and lambda > 470 nm visible-light irradiation, respectively, far higher than that of pristine g-C3N4 (481.6 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1), lambda > 420 nm and 148.6 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1), lambda > 470 nm). Moreover, stability assays show that the as-prepared CN-75 possesses satisfactory light and structure stability after ten cycling runs (4 h per cycling). This work offers a simple and effective route for fabricating high-performance nitrogen vacancies modified g-C3N4 photocatalyst on a large scale.
Etching graphitic carbon nitride by acid for enhanced photocatalytic activity toward degradation of 4-nitrophenol	Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with high photocatalytic activity toward degradation of 4-nitrophenol under visible light irradiation was prepared by HCl etching followed by ammonia neutralization. The structure, morphology, surface area, and photocatalytic properties of the prepared samples were studied. After treatment, the size of the g-C3N4 decreased from several micrometers to several hundred nanometers, and the specific area of the g-C3N4 increased from 11.5 m(2)/g to 115 m(2)/g. Meanwhile, the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 was significantly improved after treatment toward degradation of 4-nitrophenol under visible light irradiation. The degradation rate constant of the small particle g-C3N4 is 5.7 times of that of bulk g-C3N4, which makes it a promising visible light photocatalyst for future applications for water treatment and environmental remediation.

Improved visible-light activities for degrading pollutants on TiO 2/g-C3N4 nanocomposites by decorating SPR Au nanoparticles and 2,4-dichlorophenol decomposition path	It has been clearly demonstrated that the visible-light photocatalytic activities of g-C3N4 (CN) for degrading 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) and bisphenol A (BPA) could be improved by fabricating nanocomposites with a proper amount of nanocrystalline anatase TiO2. Interestingly, the visible-light activities of the amount-optimized nanocomposite could be further improved after decorating Au nanoparticles, with 5.11- and 3.1-time improvement respectively for 2,4-DCP and BPA compared to that of CN, even much higher than that of P25 TiO2 under UV-vis irradiation. Based on the transient-state surface photovoltage responses and photoelectrochemical measurements, it is confirmed that the exceptional visible-light activities of the fabricated Au-(TiO2/g-C3N4) nanocomposites are attributed to the extended visible-light response due to the surface plasmonic resonance (SPR) of decorated Au and its catalytic function, and to the enhanced charge separation by transferring electrons from CN and SPR Au to TiO2 in the nanocomposites. The highly promoted charge separation results in the effective availability of a large number of hydroxyl radicals (OH) participating in the photocatalytic oxidation process of 2,4-DCP. Furthermore, a possible mechanism of 2,4-DCP degradation is proposed according to the detailed analyses of produced intermediates. This work provides new idea for designing Au assisted nanocomposite photocatalysts for environmental remediation.
Facile synthesis of mesoporous carbon nitride and titanium dioxide nanocomposites with enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity	A facile and efficient solution combustion method was developed and employed in the fabrication of novel mesoporous carbon nitride and titanium dioxide (C3N4-TiO2) nanocomposites as advanced photocatalysts for wastewater remediation. Urea was used as the precursor of C3N4, while titanium tetra-isopropoxide served as the source of titanium. Yellow nanocomposites were produced as compared to the formed white TiO2 and C3N4 nanomaterials. Transmission electron microscopic images and N-2 adsorption/desorption analysis revealed that the fabricated nanocomposites possessed a mesoporous structure and much larger surface areas as compared to the individual constituents. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic measurements and thermogravimetric analysis were utilized to determine the composition and thermal stability of the C3N4-TiO2 nanocomposites. Tauc plots derived from the UV-vis absorption spectra revealed that the formation of the C3N4-TiO2 nanocomposites significantly narrowed the band gap energy, leading to a high visible light response in contrast to the individual TiO2 (similar to 3.2 eV) and C3N4 (similar to 2.8 eV) samples. The optimal composition of the C3N4-TiO2 nanocomposites was determined, and the new nanocomposite developed in this study exhibited high visible light activity in the photochemical oxidation of Rhodamine B, as compared to the mechanically mixed C3N4 and TiO2 sample. This significant improvement in photocatalytic activity may be attributed to the synergistic effects of the red shift in absorption and the large surface area.
Salt-template-assisted construction of honeycomb-like structured g-C3N4 with tunable band structure for enhanced photocatalytic H(2 )production	Honeycomb-like structured graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4 ) with tunable band structure was prepared through a one-step salt-template assisted approach. The honeycomb structure, cyano group defects and Na ion doping result in enhanced light absorption, improved photoexcited charge carrier separation, and up-shift of conduction band. As a consequence, the photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate is about 5.2 times higher than that of the pristine graphitic carbon nitride. This newly developed approach provides a promising way to modify other functional materials through nanostructure design coupled with electronic modulation strategy simultaneously.
Structure Transition Mechanism of Single-Crystalline Silicon, g-C3N4, and Diamond Nanocone Arrays Synthesized by Plasma Sputtering Reaction Deposition	Single-crystalline silicon, g-C3N4, and diamond nanocone arrays were synthesized on nickel-covered silicon (100) substrates by a novel method of plasma sputtering reaction deposition. The experimental results show that the morphologies, structures, and composition of the as-grown nanocones strongly depend on the ratios of the inlet mixed gases. The silicon, g-C3N4, and diamond nanocone arrays could be grown at the CH4/(N-2 + H-2) ratios of about 1/20-1/10, 1/150-1/60, and 0, respectively. The analyses of the optical emission spectra from the discharged plasma indicate that the inlet methane controls the growth of the nanocones by suppressing the Frsputtering effect to adjust the amounts of the silicon, carbon, and nitrogen atoms attaining the substrate, which determines the composition, structures, and crystallinity of the grown nanocones.
Molecularly imprinted Ag/Ag3VO4/g-C3N4 Z-scheme photocatalysts for enhanced preferential removal of tetracycline	High selectivity and fast charge separation are two important factors for photocatalytic wastewater treatment. Herein, we prepared a molecular imprinted Ag/Ag3VO4/g-C3N4 photocatalyst (MIP) that exhibited great specific recognition ability along with excellent photocatalytic activity. The ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets with high surface are used to prepare. The 2-scheme Ag3VO4/g-C3N4 heterostructure and the surface plasmon resonance of the photoreduced Ag degrees together contributed to the improvement of the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes. In addition, MIP provides the specific recognition ability to preferentially adsorb the target pollutant. The selectivity of photocatalysis was evaluated by the degradation of oxytetracycline and tetracycline solutions. Photoluminescence and transient photocurrent measurements further prove the improved charge separation efficiency of MIP. A plausible photocatalytic reaction mechanism is proposed based on electron spin resonance measurement and the active species trapping experiments, where indicates that the main active species of this photocatalytic process are center dot O-2(-) and h(+). This research provides an effective strategy for the simultaneous enhancement of selectivity and activity via molecular imprinting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
Three-dimensional g-C3N4 aggregates of hollow bubbles with high photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline	A g-C3N4 three-dimensional aggregate composed of hollow bubbles was developed by hydrothermally treating a supramolecular precursor in the presence of a soft template, Pluronic P-123, followed by annealing the obtained intermediate. While, it is found that, without the addition of P123, the obtained g-C3N4 sample consists of sheets. It has been observed that, during the annealing of the intermediate, long balloons were first formed and then transformed into hollow bubbles. And at the P123 mass fraction of 3 wt%, the obtained aggregate is mainly composed of broken hollow bubbles. It has been shown that the three-dimensional hollow bubbles, which was obtained from the intermediate prepared with 2 wt% P123, exhibits large specific surface area and pore volume, enhanced visible-light absorption region, reduced charge recombination, and increased photocurrent response. Consequently, this g-C3N4 material can degrade tetracycline by 97.9% in 12 min under visible light irradiation, which photocatalytic activity is superior to that of all the reported photocatalysts for degradation of tetracycline. It has been elucidated that, center dot O-2(-) is the main active species, and center dot OH has been also generated in the reaction system. This work sheds light on the construction of g-C3N4 three-dimensional porous structures with high photocatalytic activity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of C3N4/BiFeO3 heterojunctions: the synergistic effects of band alignment and ferroelectricity	As one of the most promising photocatalysts, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) shows a visible light response and great chemical stability. However, its relatively low photocatalytic efficiency is a major obstacle to actual applications. Here an effective and feasible method to dramatically increase the visible light photocatalytic efficiency by forming C3N4/BiFeO3 ferroelectric heterojunctions is reported, wherein the band alignment and piezo-/ferroelectricity have synergistic positive effects in accelerating the separation of the photogenerated carriers. At the optimum composition of 10 wt% BiFeO3, the heterojunction shows 1.4 times improved photocatalytic efficiency than that of the pure C3N4. Most importantly, mechanical pressing and electrical poling can also improve the photocatalytic efficiencies by 1.3 times and 1.8 times, respectively. The optimized photocatalytic efficiency is even comparable with that of some noble metal based compounds. These results not only prove the improved photocatalytic activity of the C3N4-ferroelectric heterojunctions, but also provide a new approach for designing high-performance photocatalysts by taking advantage of ferroelectricity.
Design of a direct Z-scheme photocatalyst: Preparation and characterization of Bi2O3/g-C3N4 with high visible light activity	A direct Z-scheme photocatalyst Bi2O3/g-C3N4 was prepared by ball milling and heat treatment methods. The photocatalyst was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas, photoluminescence technique (PL), and electron spin resonance (ESR) technology. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by degradation of methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine B (RhB). The results showed that Bi2O3/g-C3N4 exhibited a much higher photocatalytic activity than pure g-C3N4 under visible light illumination. The rate constants of MB and RhB degradation for Bi2O3(1.0 wt.%)/g-C3N4 are about 3.4 and 5 times that of pure g-C3N4, respectively. The migration of photogenerated carriers adopts a Z-scheme mechanism. The photoexcited electrons in the CB of Bi2O3 and photogenerated holes in the VB of g-C3N4 are quickly combined, so the photoexcited electrons in the CB of g-C3N4 and holes in the VB of Bi2O3 participate in reduction and oxidation reactions, respectively. O-center dot(2)-, (OH)-O-center dot and h(+) are the major reactive species for the Bi2O3/g-C3N4 photocatalytic system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Materials synthesis and phase transitions under shock waves	Shock wave compression of materials is accompanied by high pressure, high-strain-rate loading, elevated temperatures, large shear stresses and excessive plastic deformation. All these features create an unusual state in materials that is not possible in any processing method. Thus, in multi-component system of powders, these can lead to enhanced reactivity because of defect promoted diffusional flow of the reactants in a solid-solid chemical reaction for materials synthesis. On the other hand, in a one component system, these shock compression features may significantly influence the onset pressure, the kinetics, the mechanism and the reversibility of a phase transformation. We shall illustrate these using examples on the synthesis of beta-C3N4 and our work on the crystal to amorphous phase transitions in q-GeO2 and alpha-FePO4.
Fast Photoelectron Transfer in (C-ring)-C3N4 Plane Heterostructural Nanosheets for Overall Water Splitting	Direct and efficient photocatalytic water splitting is critical for sustainable conversion and storage of renewable solar energy. Here, we propose a conceptual design of two-dimensional C3N4-based in-plane heterostructure to achieve fast spatial transfer of photoexcited electrons for realizing highly efficient and spontaneous overall water splitting. This unique plane heterostructural carbon ring (C-ring)-C3N4 nanosheet can synchronously expedite electron hole pair separation and promote photoelectron transport through the local in-plane pi-conjugated electric field, synergistically elongating the photocarrier diffusion length and lifetime by 10 times relative to those achieved with pristine g-C3N4. As a result, the in-plane (C-ring)-C3N4 heterostructure could efficiently split pure water under light irradiation with prominent H-2 production rate up to 371 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) and a notable quantum yield of 5% at 420 nm.
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution over Erythrosin B-sensitized graphitic carbon nitride with in situ grown molybdenum sulfide cocatalyst	Erythrosin B (EB) sensitized graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was investigated using triethanolamine (TEOA) as an electron donor under visible light irradiation (lambda >420 nm). MoSx was loaded on g-C3N4 as a cocatalyst by an in situ photoreduction method during the photocatalytic reaction employing (NH4)(2)MoS4 as a precursor. EB-sensitized MoSx-g-C3N4 (EB-MoSx-g-C3N4) exhibits the higher activity and stability than both EB-sensitized g-C3N4 (EB-g-C3N4) and EB-sensitized MoSx (EB-MoSx). With deposition of 0.5 wt% MoSx, the photoactivity of EB-MoSx-g-C3N4 increases by more than 160 times after 2 h irradiation compared with that of EB-g-C3N4. The activity of EB-MoSx-g-C3N4 is 19.3 times as high as that of EB-MoSx after 10 h irradiation, and the former is much more stable than the latter. The highest apparent quantum yield for hydrogen evolution reaches 8.3% at 545 nm. The improved photoactivity and stability is owing to MoSx as an excellent hydrogen evolution cocatalyst and the efficient electron transfer among photoexcited EB, g-C3N4 and MoSx. The possible mechanism was discussed. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Review of photocatalytic membrane reactors in water treatment	
Polydopamine and Barbituric Acid Co-Modified Carbon Nitride Nanospheres for Highly Active and Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction	Carbon nitride nanospheres modified with polydopamine and barbituric acid (BA-CNS-PDA) were successfully prepared by following a template-copolymerization and post-modification strategy. The photocatalytic CO2 reduction was carried out using BA-CNS-PDA as photocatalyst, Co(bpy)(3)(2+) as the cocatalyst and TEOA as the sacrificial electron donor. The productivity and selectivity for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO on BA(20)-CNS-PDA(15) under visible-light for 4 h were measured to be 158 mu mol and 86.0 %, respectively, and are nearly 5 and 1.5 times, respectively, that of unmodified CNS. Optical characterization indicates that the outstanding photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance is a result of improved charge separation and transfer due to copolymerization with barbituric acid and enhanced visible light absorption due to polydopamine. The adsorption isotherm of CO2 demonstrates that polydopamine increase CO2 adsorption capacity and promote CO2 activation due to the presence of the amino groups.
Fe(III)-Doped g-C3N4 Mediated Peroxymonosulfate Activation for Selective Degradation of Phenolic Compounds via High-Valent Iron-Oxo Species	Herein, we proposed a new peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation system employing the Fe(III) doped g-C3N4 (CNF) as catalyst. Quite different from traditional sulfate radical-based advanced oxidation processes (SR-AOPs), the PMS/CNF system was capable of selectively degrading phenolic compounds (e.g., p-chlorophenol, 4-CP) in a wide pH range (3-9) via nonradical pathway. The generated singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) in the PMS/CNF3 (3.46 wt % Fe) system played negligible role in removing 4-CP, and high-valent iron-oxo species fixated in the nitrogen pots of g-C3N4 ( Fe-V= O) was proposed as the dominant reactive species by using dimethyl sulfoxide as a probe compound. The mechanism was hypothesized that PMS was first bound to the Fe(III)-N moieties to generate  Fe-V=O, which effectively reacted with 4-CP via electron transfer. GC-MS analysis indicated that 4-chlorocatechol and 1,4-benzoquinone were the major intermediates, which could be further degraded to carboxylates. The kinetic results suggested that the formation of  Fe-V=O was proportional to the dosages of PMS and CNF3 under the experimental conditions. Also, the PMS/CNF3 system exhibited satisfactory removal of 4-CP in the presence of inorganic anions and natural organic matters. We believe that this study will provide a new routine for effective PMS activation by heterogeneous iron-complexed catalysts to efficiently degrade organic contaminants via nonradical pathway.
Enhanced electron and mass transfer flow-through cell with C3N4-MoS2 supported on three-dimensional graphene photoanode for the removal of antibiotic and antibacterial potencies in ampicillin wastewater	An enhanced electron and mass transfer photocatalytic flow-through system was developed using three-di-mensional (3D) photoelectrode as photoanode and Pt/C air breathing electrode as cathode. The ampicillin removal activity and characteristics of the C3N4-MoS2 supported on three-dimensional graphene (C3N4-MoS2/3DG) photoelectrode were compared with other 3D materials. The removal efficiency of ampicillin with the photoanode reached 74.6 % after the 2 h of reaction. Acute antibacterial potency assessment and the ECOSAR model indicated the toxicity of ampicillin decreased during the photocatalysis reaction, which may be ascribed to the cleavage of functional groups such as amido bonds and peptide bonds. The preferable performance of the flow-through photocatalysis was attributed to excellent adsorption capacity and heterojunction mechanism of C3N4-MoS2/3DG, better mass and electron transfer ability of the flow-through system, and cooperation mechanism of the photoanode and cathode. The photoanode flow-through cell system is an attractive method to efficiently remove organic pollutants in wastewater treatment.
Facile Synthesis of Defect-Modified Thin-Layered and Porous g-C3N4 with Synergetic Improvement for Photocatalytic H-2 Production	Modulating and optimizing the diverse parameters of photocatalysts synergistically as well as exerting these advantages fully in photocatalytic reactions are crucial for the sufficient utilization of solar energy but still face various challenges. Herein, a novel and facile urea- and KOH-assisted thermal polymerization (UKATP) strategy is first developed for the preparation of defect-modified thin-layered and porous g-C3N4 (DTLP-CN), wherein the thickness of g-C3N4 was dramatically decreased, and cyano groups, nitrogen vacancies, and mesopores were simultaneously introduced into g-C3N4. Importantly, the roles of thickness, pores, and defects can be targetedly modulated and optimized by changing the mass ratio of urea, KOH, and melamine. This can remarkably increase the specific area, improve the light-harvesting capability, and enhance separation efficiency of photoexcited charge carriers, strengthening the mass transfer in g-C3N4. Consequently, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution efficiency of the DTLP-CN (1.557 mmol h(-1) g(-1), lambda > 420 nm) was significantly improved more than 48.5 times with the highest average apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 18.5% and reached as high as 0.82% at 500 nm. This work provides an effective strategy for synergistically regulating the properties of g-C3N4, and opens a new horizon to design g-C3N4-based catalysts for highly efficient solar-energy conversion.
Determination of the antigen binding capacity of antisera to collagen by gel filtration	Significant differences in the antigen binding capacity of different antisera to collagen of identical haemagglutination titres were demonstrated by using gel filtration for the isolation of collagen-anticollagen immune-complexes. A partially degraded collagen was used as the antigen. The influence of antigen concentration on antigen binding capacity was investigated with 2 antisera of different avidity. The distribution of antibody-bound antigen among IgM- and IgG- peaks indicates the participation of both immunoglobulin classes in the formation of collagen-anticollagen immune-complexes.
Design of C3N4-Based Hybrid Heterojunctions for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production Activity	
Synthesis and mechanical properties of crystalline carbon nitride superhard coatings	Crystalline beta-C3N4 was predicted to have mechanical properties similar to those of diamond. Until recently, only amorphous carbon nitride coatings were made in spite of numerous attempts. This lack of success in making crystalline coatings suggests that beta-C3N4 is metastable. Using TiN as seeding layers and under proper processing conditions, we were able to synthesize fully crystalline carbon nitride composite coatings with hardness in the 45-55 GPa range, which is at the low end of diamond. Suggestions for further improvements and implementation with other deposition techniques will be made.

Enhancement photocatalytic activity of the graphite-like C3N4 coated hollow pencil-like ZnO	The pencil-like ZnO hollow tubes with 9-12 mu m in length, 350-700 nm in width, 200 nm in wall thickness coating with g-C3N4 have been prepared via a chemical deposition process. As compared with uncoated ZnO or g-C3N4, these g-C3N4/ZnO composites showed the enhanced photocatalytic activity which can be attributed to the heterojunction structure. Furthermore, it is worth pointing out that the weight ratios of g-C3N4 to ZnO (g-C3N4/ZnO) played a significantly influence on the photodegradable properties. With increasing the mass ratio, the photocatalytic activity increased firstly and then decreased after reaching to an optimal photocatalytic performance. It can be inferred that the appreciation of g-C3N4 on the ZnO surface can improve the contact area which resulted in high separation of electrons and holes. However, excessive g-C3N4 may hinder the electrons transferring from the g-C3N4 to ZnO, and thus worse its photocatalytic performance. In our study, the g-C3N4/ZnO sample prepared with 10 wt% of g-C3N4 exhibited the optimal photodegradable efficiency which 94% of Rhodamine B (RhB) has been degraded just in 2 h.

Morphological tuning of photo-booster g-C3N4 with higher surface area and better charge transfers for enhanced power conversion efficiency of quantum dot sensitized solar cells	Photo-booster effect of g-C3N4 Nanotubes (g-C3N4 NTs) on the photovoltaic properties are investigated using the composites having ZnO Nanorods (ZnO NRs) with different composition ratios, sensitized by CdS quantum dots. Enhanced performance is attributed to the cumulative effects of this composite i.e., (i) a significant decrement of fluorescence intensity in steady state PL, (ii) faster electron lifetime and good electron injection rate from dynamic PL, and (iii) sufficient loading of sensitizer at photoanodic scaffold for better harvesting of solar energy. An increase of 32% in power conversion efficiency (PCE, eta) is observed in case of g-C3N4 NTs based device as compare to g-C3N4 Nanoflakes (g-C3N4 NFs). Increased PCE value is mainly due to (i) efficient separation and transportation of the photogenerated charge carriers along a one dimensional (1D) path, resulting in shorter lifetime of charge carriers and (ii) high surface area which provides more active sites for loading of sensitizer particles, results in an improvement of light harvesting ability. Further, electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) analyses showed an efficient interfacial charge transfer by reducing the recombination processes i.e., the back transferring of photoexcited electron at electrode/electrolyte interface.

In-Situ Growing Mesoporous CuO/O-Doped g-C3N4 Nanospheres for Highly Enhanced Lithium Storage	The development of lithium-ion batteries using transition metal oxides has recently become more attractive, due to their higher specific capacities, better rate capability, and high energy densities. Herein, the in situ growth of advanced mesoporous CuO/O-doped g-C3N4 nanospheres is carried out in a two step hydrothermal process at 180 °C and annealing in air at 300 °C. When used as an anode material, the CuO/O-doped g-C3N4 nanospheres achieve a high reversible discharge specific capacity of 738 mAhg-1 and a capacity retention of ∼75.3% after 100 cycles at a current density 100 mAg-1 compared with the pure CuO (412 mAhg-1, 47%) and O-doped g-C3N4 (66 mAhg-1, 53%). Even at high current density 1 Ag-1, they exhibit a reversible discharge specific capacity of 503 mAhg-1 and capacity retention ∼80% over 500 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance of the CuO/O-doped g-C3N4 nanocomposite is attributed to the following factors: (I) the in situ growing CuO/O-doped g-C3N4 avoids CuO nanoparticle aggregation, leading to the improved lithium ion transfer and electrolyte penetration inside the CuO/O-doped g-C3N4 anode, thus promoting the utilization of CuO; (II) the porous structure provides efficient space for Li+ transfer during the insertion/extraction process to avoid large volume changes; (III) the O-doping g-C3N4 decreases its band gap, ensuring the increased electrical conductivity of CuO/O-doped g-C3N4; and (IV) the strong interaction between CuO and O-doped g-C3N4 ensures the stability of the structure during cycling.
Cerium promoted V-g-C3N4 as highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts for the direct benzene hydroxylation	A series of Ce x -V-g-C3N4 catalysts with different cerium content were synthesized by a facile co-assembly method. Compared with pure V-g-C3N4 catalyst, the addition of cerium facilitated the high dispersion of vanadium species as well as the benzene adsorption ability of the corresponding catalysts. Also, the existence of cerium promoted the partial reduction of vanadium species, which improved the redox property of vanadium species as the active centres. The Ce x -V-g-C3N4 catalysts showed considerably improved activity in the benzene hydroxylation reaction compared with V-g-C3N4 catalyst. Among the catalysts studied, Ce0.07-0.07 V-g-C3N4 exhibited the best catalytic activity with a benzene conversion of 33.7% and a phenol yield of 32.3% with good structural and catalytic stability, while only 24.7% of benzene conversion and phenol yield of 24.2% were obtained over 0.07 V-g-C3N4.
Visible Light-Driven Membraneless Photocatalytic Fuel Cell toward Self-Powered Aptasensing of PCB77	Artificial photocatalytic systems have been extensively established to mimic the natural solar-energy conversion process for developing useful photoelectric devices. In this work, a membraneless, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-based photocatalytic fuel cell (PFC) operated under visible light was proposed and applied in self-powered sensing of 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB77). The PFC was comprised of a photoanode fabricated with gold nanoparticles-decorated graphitic C3N4 nanosheet and a cathode modified with hemin-graphene nanocomposites. The combination of both photocatalytic oxidation and electrochemical reduction of H2O2 processes led to electron transfer in the external circuit, which could generate a certain electric power output. Taking the advantage of the inhibited output performance of PFC by PCB77 which interacted with aptamer immobilize on the photoanode, a self-powered aptasensor driven by visible light was achieved, without applying an external electric source. Thus, a highly sensitive and selective self-powered aptasensor for PCB77 was successfully demonstrated.

Nanorod-like alpha-Bi2O3: a highly active photocatalyst synthesized using g-C3N4 as a template	The nanorod-like alpha-Bi2O3 have been synthesized from the microrod-like alpha-Bi2O3 using g-C3N4 as a template. The photocatalytic activity of alpha-Bi2O3 is highly improved by nearly 800% in the oxidation of the gaseous IPA (isopropyl alcohol). The formation mechanism of the nanorod-like alpha-Bi2O3 was further studied, and demonstrated to be the CO2 corrosion effects.

Stress development during deposition of CNx thin films	We have investigated the influence of deposition parameters on stress generation in CNx (0.3<x <0.5) thin films deposited onto Si(001) substrates by reactive magnetron sputtering of C in pure N-2 discharges. Film stress, sigma, which in all cases is compressive, decreases with an increase in the N-2 pressure, P-N2, due to structural changes induced by the pressure-dependent variation in the average energy of particles bombarding the film during deposition. The film stress sigma is also a function of the film growth temperature, T-s, and exhibits a maximum value of similar to 5 GPa at 350 degrees C. Under these conditions, the films have a distorted microstructure consisting of a three-dimensional, primarily sp(2) bonded, network. In contrast, films deposited at T-s<200 degrees C with a low stress are amorphous. At 350 degrees C<T-s<600 degrees C, sigma gradually decreases as T-s is increased and the microstructure becomes mon graphitic and contains fewer defects. Nanoindentation measurements show that the films grown at 350 degrees C exhibit the highest hardness and elasticity. (C) 1998 American Institute of Physics. [S0003-6951(98)01320-5].
g-C3N4 modified Bi2O3 composites with enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity	Novel g-C3N4 modified Bi2O3 (g-C3N4/Bi2O3) composites were synthesized by a mixing-calcination method. The samples were characterized by thermogravimetry (TG), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS), photoluminescence (PL) and photocurrent-time measurement (PT). The photocatalytic activity of the composites was evaluated by degradation of Rhodamine B (RHB) and 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) under visible light irradiation (> 400 nm). The results indicated that the g-C3N4/Bi2O3 composites showed higher photocatalytic activity than that of Bi2O3 and g-C3N4. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the g-C3N4/Bi2O3 composites could be attributed to the suitable band positions between g-C3N4 and Bi2O3. This leads to a low recombination between the photogenerated electronhole pairs. The proposed mechanism for the enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4/Bi2O3 composites was proven by PL and PT analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Visible-light-driven photooxidation of alcohols using surface-doped graphitic carbon nitride	Carbon-nanodot-doped g-C3N4 is used as a photocatalyst to promote the aerobic oxidation of alcohols and oxyfunctionalisation of activated hydrocarbons. A critical E-factor analysis of the current reaction system reveals its limitations en route to environmentally acceptable oxidation procedures.
Enhanced Visible-Light-Induced Photoactivity of Type-II CeO2/g-C3N4 Nanosheet toward Organic Pollutants Degradation	Photodegradation has been considered as an efficient environmental remediation technology to eliminate organic pollutants from wastewater, and the calling for high-performance photocatalysts is endless. Herein, we developed an efficient solid-state thermolysis route for the mass production of type-II CeO2/g-C3N4 nanosheet (CeO2/CNNS) serving as efficient photocatalysts toward bisphenol A (BPA) degradation under visible light illumination. The microstructures, compositions, and optical properties of the obtained samples were characterized by multitechniques, and n-n heterojunction was verified to be perfectly formed in CeO2/CNNS with an intimate contact interface. A total of 93.7% BPA was removed by the optimal CeO2/CNNS composites after 80 min visible light irradiation, but only 65.0% and 14.4% of the BPA were removed by CNNS and CeO2, respectively. It was mainly attributed to the matched energy levels of the CeO2/CNNS heterostructure, which facilitated the migration and separation of photoinduced charge carriers. Combining trapping experiments and ESR analysis, the results indicated that holes (h(+)) and superoxide radicals (O-2(center dot-)) dominated the photodegradation reactions. As expected, the CeO2/CNNS composites still remained stable up to the sixth cycling test, implying the possible application for actual wastewater treatment. This work highlighted the mechanism of CeO2/CNNS composites and gained a deeper insight for the fabrication of heterojunction catalysts and their application in environmental pollution management.
Synthesis of novel ternary Bi2WO6/CeO2/g-C3N4composites with enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity for removal of organic and Cr(VI) from wastewater	In this study, novel ternary Bi2WO6/CeO2/g-C3N4composites were synthesized successfully in this study, which exhibited enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity for oxidization of rhodamine B (RhB) and tetracycline hydrochloride (TH) as well as reduction of Cr(VI). The characteristics of the as-prepared composites were investigated in detail by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared spectra (FT-IR), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-DRS), Photoluminescence spectra (PL), Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott-Schottky curves. The results demonstrated that the ternary heterojunctions were formed between Bi2WO6, CeO(2)and g-C3N4, which can narrow the band gap to improve separation and migration of photogenerated electrons-hole pairs, so that the lifetimes of photogenerated charge carriers were prolonged to involve in photocatalytic reaction. Therefore, Bi2WO6/CeO2/g-C3N4can generate abundant free radicals under visible-light irradiation to enhance photocatalytic activity. BW/Ce/g-3 can degrade 99.24% of RhB in 75 min and 54.76% of TH in 105 min. More than that, BW/Ce/g-3 exhibited enhanced photocatalytic reduction for Cr(VI) (94.85%, 30 min). Meanwhile, the best synthesized condition was determined that the adding amount of CeO(2)was 0.043 g and g-C3N4was 0.02 g. This study not only provided a mothed to synthesize Bi2WO6/CeO2/g-C3N4ternary heterojunctions, but also confirmed a photocatalyst for degrading both organic pollution and heavy metals wastewater.
N-doped C dot/CoAl-layered double hydroxide/g-C3N4 hybrid composites for efficient and selective solar-driven conversion of CO2 into CH4	Converting CO2 into value-added fuel by utilizing abundant solar energy could in principle minimize fossil fuel consumption and anthropogenic CO2 emissions. However, developing catalytic systems with high selectivity and efficiency is necessary for photocatalytic CO2 conversion. Here we report the fabrication of a N-doped C dot/CoAl-layered double hydroxide/g-C3N4 (NCD/LDH/CN) hybrid heterojunction photocatalyst for high efficiency and selectivity reduction of CO2 with water into CH4 under simulated-solar-light illumination. The NCD/LDH/CN hybrid photocatalyst demonstrated remarkable CH4 production with an optimum rate of 25.69 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), an apparent quantum yield of 0.62%, and 99% selectivity for CH4. This NCD/LDH/CN hybrid system also exhibited exceptional stability and durability during consecutive test cycles with no apparent change in activity. The high activity and stability of the NCD/LDH/CN hybrid toward CO2 photoreduction is essentially attributable to the strong synergy among the NCD, LDH, and CN constituents, which hinder charge recombination by accelerating charge transportation processes, together with the favorable properties such as broad optical response and good CO2 adsorption capability. We explored the role of the NCDs in the NCD/LDH/CN hybrid system as a metal-free co-catalyst for the efficient and selective production of CH4 from CO2 photoreduction. Thus, the present report provides new insights into the rational fabrication of noble-metal-free photocatalysts for efficient and selective sustainable hydrocarbon production from photocatalytic reduction of CO2.

Enhanced visible light photocatalytic performance and reaction mechanism on Ag/AgCl-LaCO3OH nanorods composite	Air pollution has become a focused issue worldwide with the rapid development of industry. As one of the major air pollutants, nitric oxide (NO) could cause to serious atmospheric problems, such as acid rain, haze and photocheinical smog. Photocatalysis as a green technology has received increasing attention, because it has represented greatly potential application over the late decades. As a novel photocatalyst. LaCO3OH possesses relatively negative conduction band and positive valence band edges, which can be enable to sufficient potential for photocatalytic air decomposition. But the band gap of LaCO3OH (4.1 eV) allows only a small portion of solar spectrum in the ultraviolet (UV) light region to be absorbed. To extend the light absorption spectra into the visible light region, the combination of narrow band gap Ag/AgC1 with the wide band gap LaCO3OH to build heterojunction could utilize abundant solar light. Noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) showed strong visible light absorption due to surface Plasmon resonance effect (SPR). In particular, silver NPs show SPR in the visible region. which has been utilized to develop efficient plasmonic photocatalysts.In this study, a three -component Ag/AgCl-LaCO3OH nanorod photocatalyst has been fabricated successfully through a chemical precipitation treatment and applied to photocatalytic NO removal. The as -prepared samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, U V-vis DRS, PL and ESR. The photocatalytic NO oxidation process was monitored by in situ DRIFTS. The results indicated that the visible -light harvesting and the photogenerated carrier separation can be enhanced simultaneously, which could result from introduction of Ag/AgCl into LaCO3OH (LCO) nanorod photocatalyst. Under visible -light irradiation. the photogenerated electron-hole pairs separation is promoted by the plasma resonance (SPR) effect of the metallic Ag-0. The hot electrons would be transferred to the defect level endowed by the oxygen vacancies of the LCO. Subsequently, the electron can be transferred to the surface of LCO, captured by O-2 to form O-2(-), radicals, which plays a dominant role in the photocatalytic NO oxidation. In addition, the holes would be transferred to the surface of AgCl, and interact with Cl- transform Cl-0. which can directly participate in the oxidation of NO. Furthermore. Cl can be reduced to Cl- and react with Ag+ to forming AgCl, avoiding the photocorrosion of AgCl effectively. Meanwhile, the effect of the mol ratio of Ag/AgC1 on the photocatalytic performance was also evaluated. The optimized Ag/AgCl-LCO (mol ratio at 75%) nanorods demonstrated a high NO removal ratio of 54.0%, which far exceeding that of the individual LCO (3.1%) or Ag/AgC1 (18.0%) photocatalyst. Moreover, the in situ FT-1R spectra was used to dynamically monitor the intermediate toxic by-products, in combination with the active species, and further reveal the mechanism of photocatalytic NO oxidation from the molecular level. The reaction mechanism can be described as Ag + visible light -> e(-) +h(+), e(-)+O-2 -> center dot O-2(-), h(+) _AgCl Cl-0+Ag+ center dot O-2(-), +NO -> NO3-, Cl-0+NO -> NO3- +Cl- NO+2 center dot OH -> NO2+H2O, NO2+center dot OH -> NO3- +H+ and Cl- +Ag+ -> AgCl. The present work could provide navel perspectives for advancing the photocatalysis efficiency, offer a new insight of the photocatalytic reaction mechanism and promote large-scale environmental decontamination applications of plasma -based semiconductor composites.
Boosting photocatalytic degradation of RhB via interfacial electronic effects between Fe-based ionic liquid and g-C3N4	The Fe-based ionic liquid doped g-C3N4 (FeeCN) photocatalyst was firstly prepared base on ultrathin g-C3N4 obtained by multiple calcination method with a metal-based reactive ionic liquid [Omim]FeCl4 for the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB). Experimental results revealed that Fe3+ species were doped into the framework of g-C3N4. The effect of the amount of Fe-doping on the catalytic activity was performed. The result showed that the FeeCN could effectively degrade RhB under the condition of visible light irradiation. The photocurrent analysis showed that the incorporation of Fe3+ into g-C3N4 material could accelerate the separation of the photogenerated carriers significantly. At the same time, the reactive species generated during the photodegradation process were tested by radicals trapping experiments and electron spin resonance (ESR). It was proposed that the synergistic effect of O-2(center dot-) and center dot OH contributed to degrade RhB efficiently. (C) 2019, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

A novel vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) from elasmobranch intestine has full affinity for mammalian pancreatic VIP receptors	A peptide that cross reacted with N-terminal, but not C-terminal, antisera to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) was isolated from extracts of intestine from the dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula. Microsequence analysis gave the structure His-Ser-Asp-Ala-Val-Phe-Thr-Asp-Asn-Tyr-Ser-Arg-Ile-Arg-Lys-Gln-Met-Ala-Val-Lys - Lys-Tyr-Ile-Asn-Ser-Leu-Leu-Ala-NH2. C-terminal amidation was determined by HPLC analysis of phenylthiocarbamyl amino acid derivatives after carboxypeptidase Y digestion. The peptide differs at five positions from the porcine octacosapeptide. Dogfish VIP was equipotent with its porcine counterpart in inhibiting binding of 125I-labelled VIP to guinea pig dispersed pancreatic acini, and in stimulating amylase secretion by the same preparation. The data indicate a strong conservation of VIP during evolution and permit identification of residues crucial for bioactivity.
Theoretical study of transition metals supported on g-C3N4 as electrochemical catalysts for CO(2 )reduction to CH3OH and CH4	
Deposited CuBi2O4 and Bi3ClO4 nanoparticles on g-C3N4 nanosheet: a promising visible light-induced photocatalyst toward the removal of tetracycline hydrochloride and rhodamine B	A facile sol-gel procedure has efficiently fabricated for novel ternary p-n-p g-C3N4 nanosheet/CuBi2O4/Bi3ClO4 nanocomposites. Various techniques such as XRD, EDX, FTIR, XPS, FESEM, TEM, HRTEM, DLS, PL, BET, photocurrent, EIS, UV-Vis DRS, and TGA were adopted to analyze the photocatalysts. The as-prepared nanocomposites were utilized as visible light-induced photocatalysts for photodegradation of rhodamine B as an organic dye and tetracycline hydrochloride as an antibiotic. Among the ternary nanocomposites, the g-C3N4 nanosheet/CuBi2O4/Bi3ClO4 (20:20) shows the most efficient photocatalytic ability toward the degradation of rhodamine B and tetracycline hydrochloride. The results revealed that 98% of rhodamine B and 99% of tetracycline hydrochloride were degraded within 20 and 30 min by photocatalytic reaction, respectively. These results are explained by the formation of p-n-p heterojunction between three semiconductors, more visible light harvesting, and high separation of carrier charges. A possible mechanism is proposed. The superoxide radicals and holes were determined as the important reactive species involved in the photodegradation process. The recycling studies showed that the g-C3N4 nanosheet/CuBi2O4/Bi3ClO4 (20:20) photocatalyst prepared was highly stable and can be recycled and reused up to forth successful cycles without major loss in its photocatalytic ability.
CdS/g-C3N4 Hybrids with Improved Photostability and Visible Light Photocatalytic Activity	Novel composite photocatalysts consisting of CdS and graphitic carbon nitride (CdS/g-C3N4) with different ratios of CdS were prepared. The CdS/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts were characterized in detail and their photocatalytic activity was evaluated by using rhodamine B and colorless metronidazole as probes. Compared with pure g-C3N4, the CdS/g-C3N4 composite exhibits significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation. More importantly, g-C3N4 substantially reinforces the photostability of CdS nanowires even in a nonsacrificial system. The synergistic effect between CdS and g-C3N4 is found to be primarily responsible for enhancement of the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, which helps improve the photocatalytic performance. A probable photodegradation process of metronidazole was proposed based on an analysis of the degradation products. This study provides new insight into the preparation of highly efficient and stable sulfide-based composite photocatalysts and facilitates their application in a number of environmentally sensitive areas.
A facile synthesis of goethite-modified g-C3N4 composite for photocatalytic degradation of tylosin in an aqueous solution	The goethite/g-C3N4 photocatalyst was successfully synthesized by a simple and convenient method. The properties and structure of the as-prepared catalysts were characterized by a variety of analytical methods. The results indicated goethite was uniformly accumulated on the surface of g-C3N4. Furthermore, a novel binary goethite/g-C3N4 photocatalyst was successfully constructed by loading goethite into the g-C3N4 surface as an electron medium. The photodegradation efficiency of goethite/g-C3N4 composites for TYL was studied under simulated sunlight irradiation. The results show that the photodegradation efficiency of goethite/g-C3N4 composites on TYL is much higher than that of goethite and g-C3N4 under simulated sunlight irradiation. The content of the goethite in the composites was analyzed and compared under simulated solar irradiation to further improve the photocatalytic activity. In all as-synthesized composites, the goethite/g-C3N4 with 50 wt% of goethite have the highest photodegradation efficiency and can decompose almost all TYL within 30 min under simulated solar illumination. A sample of goethite/g-C3N4 also exhibited favorable stability and durability. It is a promising green and non-toxic photocatalyst that can be used to treat water contaminated with antibiotics.
3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole-derived graphitic carbon nitride for photodynamic therapy	Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been shown as a promising visible-light photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy (PDT) application. Nevertheless, its therapeutic efficiency is limited by the low efficiency of visible-light utilization. To overcome this issue, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole-derived graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (g-C3N5 NSs) are prepared for PDT application. The addition of nitrogen-rich triazole group into the g-C3N4 motif significantly makes the light absorption of g-C3N5 NSs red-shift with the band gap down to 1.95 eV, corresponding to a absorption edge at a wavelength of 636 nm. g-C3N5 NSs generate superoxide anion radicals (O2•-) and singlet oxygen (1O2) under the irradiation of a low-intensity white light emitting diode. Owing to the high efficiency of visible-light utilization, g-C3N5 NSs show about 9.5 fold photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 NSs. In vitro anticancer studies based on the results of CCK-8 assay, Calcein-AM/PI cell-survival assay and photo-induced intracellular ROS level analysis in living HeLa cells demonstrate the potential of g-C3N5 NSs as a low-toxic and biocompatible high-efficient photosensitizer for PDT.
Energy level tuning of CdSe colloidal quantum dots in ternary 0D-2D-2D CdSe QD/B-rGO/O-gC3N4 as photocatalysts for enhanced hydrogen generation	Colloidal quantum dots (QD) electronic properties are tailorable via modifications of its quantum confinement environment. Herein, surface-chemistry-mediated approach through the application of unique surface thiol ligands (thioglycolic acid, glutathione, 3-mercaptopropioninc acid and N-Acetylcysteine) exhibited energy level and gap shifts in aqueous CdSe QDs. Trends in the photocatalytic performance employing ligand-specific CdSe QDs are consistent with their respective measured energy and gap level. Results underscore that a still underutilized mean of surface-chemistry-mediated modification of colloidal CdSe QDs can be employed as a versatile parameter in the performance optimizations of QD photocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen (H-2) reactions. This optimized CdSe QD is further utilized as sensitizers to bolster and facilitate effective charge transfer across the ternary, multi-level heterointerfaces of 0D-2D-2D CdSe QD/B-rGO/O-gC3N4. Upon loading, the ternary composite achieved a maximum H-2 evolution of 1435 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) even without the help of precious metal cocatalyst which is otherwise required when used as individual unit. This augmented photoactivity is attributed to the synergetic effect of CdSe sensitization and p-n junction administered by the p-type B-rGO and n-type O-g-C3N4.
High temperature nitriding of grey cast iron substrates in arc plasma heated furnace	Grey cast iron substrates were case nitrided at 1000-1100 degrees C by varying several process parameters such as nitriding time, flowrate of N(2) and nitriding gas configuration. Ar and N(2) were mixed with N(2) to change the configuration and to observe their influence on the nitrided case. Nitriding was carried out in a specially designed arc plasma heated reactor with water cooled steel casing. X-ray diffraction studies show that the nitride peaks arise due to growth of iron nitride phases such as gamma' (Fe(4)N: 5.7-6.1% N), epsilon (Fe(3)N: 8-11.2% N) and carbon nitride (C3N4). Typical surface morphologies of the 10-30 mu m nitride layer were studied by SEM. Microhardness studies exhibited twofold improvement of surface hardness. Nanoindentation test indicated poor plastic behaviour of the surface. Micro-Raman spectra of the nitided case established the presence of beta-C3N4, a superhard phase. Nitrided grey cast iron may find use in wear and corrosion resistant dies, machine components and parts in various industrial applications.
Gold nanoparticles enhanced electrochemiluminescence of graphite-like carbon nitride for the detection of Nuclear Matrix Protein 22	A novel label-free electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor was developed for the detection of Nuclear Matrix Protein 22 (NMP 22) based on the graphite-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and gold nanopartides (AuNPs). Graphite-like carbon nitride was firstly combined with AuNPs, which promoted the electrons transfer and enhanced the ECL intensity of g-C3N4 largely. Then, anti-NMP 22 was immobilized onto the electrode through Au-NH2 without the usage of crosslinking agents. The connection between AuNPs and antibody influenced the conductive performance of AuNPs, leading to some decrease of ECL intensity. Then, bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution was dropped on the surface to block nonspecific binding sites. Finally, after the specific immunoreaction between NMP 22 and anti-NMP 22, the ECL intensity decreased further, because the protein on the electrode hindered the diffusion of luminescent reagents and electrons toward the electrode surface. Therefore, a linear relation between ECL intensity and the logarithm of NMP 22 concentration was obtained from 50.0 pg mL(-1) to 2.0 ng/mL (R-2 = 0.988) with the detection limit of 10.0 pg mL(-1). The proposed ECL immunosensor provides a rapid, simple, and sensitive immunoassay strategy for protein detection, which might be promising for clinical application. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

N/Ti3+-codoped triphasic TiO2/g-C3N4 heterojunctions as visible-light photocatalysts for the degradation of organic contaminants	Herein, a series of N/Ti3+-codoped triphasic TiO2/g-C3N4 heterojunctions were constructed by a simple hydrothermal treatment of TiN and g-C3N4 and systematically investigated by a number of characterization techniques. During the hydrothermal reaction, TiN is completely converted to a N/Ti3+-codoped triphasic heterophase junction, TiO2, and the activated g-C3N4 can form heterojunctions with TiO2. Importantly, a red-shift of the absorption edge, enhanced absorption intensity, and improved photocatalytic activity were observed for the N/Ti3+-codoped triphasic TiO2/g-C3N4 heterojunctions as compared to the case of N/Ti3+-codoped triphasic TiO2 and pure TiO2. Especially, the N/Ti3+-codoped triphasic TiO2/g-C3N4 heterojunctions with an optimal molar ratio of 1:0.025 exhibited highest visible-light photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methylene blue, rhodamine B, phenol, and levofloxacin. Furthermore, the photoelectrochemical and electrochemical impedance spectra measurements revealed that the prepared heterojunctions displayed more efficient electron-hole separation. The enhanced photoactivity is attributed to the synergistic effect of integrated factors, including N/Ti3+ doping levels, triphasic heterophase junctions, and TiO2/g-C3N4 heterojunctions, which account for the improved charge separation efficiency and extended light absorption range and intensity. In this study, a novel structure of TiO2-based heterojunction photocatalysts was developed by a simple one-step hydrothermal approach, and an efficient route to improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 was revealed.
Hierarchical CdIn 2 S 4 microspheres wrapped by mesoporous g-C3N4 ultrathin nanosheets with enhanced visible light driven photocatalytic reduction activity	In this investigation, a series of hierarchical CdIn2S4/g-C3N4 nanocomposites were firstly synthesized by a facile one-pot hydrothermal strategy, wherein the mesoporous g-C3N4 nanosheets were in-situ self-wrapped onto CdIn2S4 nanosheets. Systematic characterization by XRD, FT-IR, UV-vis DRS, SEM, TEM, HAAF-STEM, XPS, photoelectrochemical tests were employed to analyze the phase structure, chemical composition, morphology and photocatalytic mechanism. The application, including photo-redox reaction and photocatalytic water splitting, were used to estimate the photocatalytic activity of as-obtained CdIn2S4/g-C3N4 nanocomposites. The results indicate that CdIn2S4/g-C3N4 heterostructures exhibit more efficient improvement of the photocatalytic performances towards photo-reduction of 4-NA to corresponding 4-PDA and photocatalytic H2 generation from water splitting than these counterparts as results of construction of intimate interfacial contact, which would promote the separation of photo-generated holes and electrons. Meanwhile, benefitting from the excellent surface wrap, the CdIn2S4/g-C3N4 nanocomposites possess notable enhanced photocatalytic stability. This research may provide a promising way to fabricate highly efficient photocatalysts with excellent stability and expand the application of CdIn2S4 in fine chemical engineering.
Enhanced photocatalytic activity of graphitic carbon nitride synthesized by protonated precursor approach	A simple and repeatable method has been developed to synthesize g-C3N4 via a pyrolysis of protonated precursors, with the simultaneous doping and controlled morphology. Protonated precursors with morphology of polyhedrons, nanoflakes, and nanowires are achieved after melamine has been treated by sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and nitric acid, respectively. After pyrolysis of protonated precursors, as-attained S-g-C3N4 (derived from sulfuric acid treated melamine) exhibit remarkable photocatalyst performance owing to a delicate band gap and high specific surface area. Specifically speaking, an H-2 evolution rate of S-g-C3N4 (0.473 mmol/h) is about four times than that of N-g-C3N4 (derived from nitric acid treated melamine). Besides, S-g-C3N4 can endow a complete degradation of RhB within 120 min. The merits of this research provide a universality and reproducible approach to synthesize novel photocatalyst for energy conservation and environmental protection.
Osteoblast behavior on various ultra short pulsed laser deposited surface coatings	Ultra short pulsed laser deposition technique was utilized to create amorphous diamond, alumina and carbon nitride, and two different titania coatings on silicon wafers, thus producing five different surface deposited films with variable physico-chemical properties. The surface characterizations, including the roughness, the contact angle and the zeta potential measurements were performed before we tested the growth properties of human osteoblast-like Saos-2 cells on these surfaces (three separate experiments). The average roughness and hydrophobicity were the highest on titania-deposited surfaces, while carbon nitride was the most hydrophilic one. Osteoblasts on all surfaces showed a flattened, spread-out morphology, although on amorphous diamond the cell shape appeared more elongated than on the other surfaces. On rough titania, the area covered by the osteoblasts was smaller than on the other ones. Cell proliferation assay did not show any statistically significant differences.
Grafting Fe(III) species on carbon nanodots/Fe-doped g-C3N4 via interfacial charge transfer effect for highly improved photocatalytic performance	Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are coupled with Fe-doped g-C3N4 to prepare a binary composite photocatalyst, which shows retarded recombination of photo-induced carriers and enhanced surface absorption active sites. Then, interfacial charge transfer effect (IFCT) is introduced the binary composite by grafting Fe(III) species on the surface of CQDs/Fe-doped g-C3N4 via a facile impregnation method. The obtained ternary Fe(III)/CQDs/Fe-doped g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst exhibits largely increased optical absorption with its absorption region extended to 1200 nm and efficiently inhibited charge recombination through the IFCT effect. It is revealed that the increased surface absorption active sites provided by CQDs lead to more amount of Fe(III) species anchored in the ternary photocatalyst than in the binary Fe(III)/Fe-doped g-C3N4 composite, which favors the photocatalytic activity. The EPR probe experiments elucidate that center dot OH active species could be generated from the ternary Fe(III)/CQDs/Fe-doped g-C3N4 photocatalyst under visible light irritation, originating from the cooperation between the IFCT effect and the photo-Fenton reaction due to the existence of the Fe(III) species, which accounts for its highly enhanced photocatalytic performance on the degradation of MO and phenol.

Decoration of MoS2 on g-C3N4 surface for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction	The increasing demand for energy and strain on the environment due to human activities has led to an increased focus on the development of cleaner alternative fuels. Hydrogen gas is found as a substitute in the progress of sustainable energy sources due to its high calorific values and clean combustion products. In this work molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) decorated on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was synthesized via a simple hydrothermal route. The morphology and surface structure of MoS2/g-C3N4 were analyzed by SEM, TEM, and EDS techniques. The crystal structure, optical properties, and elemental composition of the catalyst were investigated by PXRD, UVevis, RAMAN, and XPS. BET analysis is carried out to determine the surface area of both MoS2 and MoS2/g-C3N4. The catalyst material, MoS2/g-C3N4 demonstrates enormous improvement in production of H-2 with low onset potentials (similar to 0.24 V vs. RHE), small Tafel slop (63 mV/dec), and excellent cycling stability as compared with bare MoS2. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the MoS2/g-C3N4 heterostructure could be attributed to higher charge carrier mobility in heterostructure interface, improved specific activity and large surface area. The focus of this study is to construct a new MoS2 based semiconductor heterostructure electrocatalyst with improved HER activity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Synthesis of g-C3N4 by different precursors under burning explosion effect and its photocatalytic degradation for tylosin	The use of abundant sunlight for semiconductor photo-degradation of antibiotics is an ideal way to solve global water pollution. Here, the sodium nitrate modified photocatalysts exhibits enhanced photocatalytic efficiency for degradation of tylosin under simulated sunlight irradiation over g-C3N4 alone. In addition, the pure g-C3N4 and sodium nitrate modified g-C3N4 photocatalysts were investigated in terms of their crystal structures, morphologies, optical properties by using XRD, SEM, TEM, Raman, FTIR, UV-vis and XPS. On the basis of these. results, the morphology dependence of the visible light absorption and the photocatalytic efficiency under simulated sunlight irradiation has been systematically investigated. It was found that the type of precursors and the molar ratio of sodium nitrate have an evident impact on the crystal structure of g-C3N4, and photocatalytic performance due to varied reaction pathways and degree of condensation. The photocatalytic activity evaluated under simulated sunlight indicates that the as-synthesized photocatalysts is effective in obtaining the energy of solar spectrum and transforming it into the chemical energy for tylosin degradation.
Construction of 3D porous g-C3N4/AgBr/rGO composite for excellent visible light photocatalytic activity	A multiple transmission channels, heterojunction and 3D PCN/AgBr/rGO photocatalyst was successfully synthetized by introducing the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) covering AgBr onto the surface of 3D porous g-C3N4 (PCN). In PCN/AgBr/rGO, PCN as a semiconductor photocatalyst provides the 3D framework, the heterojunction was formed with AgBr particles and PCN, rGO promotes the electron transfer simultaneously and introduces a multiple transmission channels system to increase the active species. Thanks to the heterojunction formed between PCN and AgBr, resulting rapid separation of photo-generated e(-)/h(+) at interface. The 3D PCN/AgBr/rGO nanocomposite exhibits excellent photocatalytic efficiencies for tetracycline (TC) up to 78.4% within 90 min and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) up to 68.2% within 6h. The photocatalytic rate of PCN/AgBr/rGO was much higher than 3D PCN (21%), AgBr particles (31%) and most of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts in TC degradation. Moreover, the PCN/AgBr/rGO shows high photocatalytic stability due to the significantly photocatalytic stability after four photo-degradation cycles. This study highlights the potential application of PCN/AgBr/rGO highly efficient waste water purification.
Morphology and band structure regulation of graphitic carbon nitride microspheres by solvothermal temperature to boost photocatalytic activity	Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) microspheres (CNMS) were fabricated via a solvothermal method by using supramolecular complexes of dicyandiamide and cyanuric chloride as precursors. The effect of solvothermal temperature on the morphology, band structure, and activity was systematically investigated. Structural characterization results indicate that the samples prepared at 180 A degrees C (CNMS-180) and 200 A degrees C (CNMS-200) possess spherical morphology, while irregular bulk particles were obtained at 160 A degrees C (CN-160). In addition, the band gap increased as the solvothermal temperature decreased from 200 to 160 A degrees C. In comparison with CN-160 and CNMS-200, the valence band of CNMS-180 was more positive and thus gives higher photo-oxidation capability. Accordingly, CNMS-180 exhibits higher photocatalytic degradation efficiency on Rhodamine B, stronger photocurrent response, and lower charge transfer resistance. Additionally, CNMS-180 exhibits excellent stability after four runs. This work might provide a guidance for the regulation of morphology and band structure of g-C3N4-based materials prepared at low temperatures.
A systematic investigation of the catalytic performances of monolayer carbon nitride nanosheets C1-xNx	Graphitic carbon nitrides (CNs) are potential candidate materials for the electro-catalytic industry due to their unique physical and chemical properties. However, to date, a full understanding of the electro-catalytic properties of CNs is still lacking. Herein, by using density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigate the catalytic performances in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), N-2 reduction reaction (NRR), and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) of monolayer graphitic carbon nitrides (C1-xNx), C3N (x = 1/4), C2N (x = 1/3), and g-C3N4 (x = 4/7). We also evaluated the NRR activity of B doped C1-xNx, and the CO2RR activity of Cu and Pd modified C1-xNx. The cohesive energy and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) results show that C3N, C2N, and g-C3N4 are stable at room temperature. The C3N-C1 site is predicted to deliver the best HER catalytic performance with a reaction Gibbs free energy (Delta G(H*)) of -0.03 eV (close to the ideal value (0 eV)). Among the studied C1-xNx materials, the C3N-C2 site is predicted to possess a favorable eta(OER) of 0.82 V for OER. Pure C3N, C2N, and g-C3N4 are not suitable for NRR and CO2RR. Due to the strong hybridization between the N 2p orbital and the B 2p orbital, the NRR performances of B doped B-N-C2N, B-N-C3N, and B-N-g-C3N4 are greatly enhanced, with corresponding overpotential eta(NRR) of 0.57 V, 0.70 V, and 0.72 V, respectively. The transition metals Cu and Pd can enhance the CO2RR activity of C3N, C2N, and g-C3N4. The limiting potentials U-L of pure C3N, C2N, and g-C3N4 are 0.96 V, 0.86 V, and 2.37 V, respectively, while these values are 0.63 V, 0.68 V, and 0.77 V with Cu or Pd modification. This work provides deep understanding of the catalytic properties of monolayer C1-xNx and guidance for synthesizing higher activity catalysts in the future.
Hybrid materials based on conjugated polymers and inorganic semiconductors as photocatalysts: from environmental to energy applications	Photocatalysts provide a sustainable way to remove pollutants or store energy in the form of solar fuels by processes such as water splitting and CO2 photoreduction (artificial photosynthesis). Research in this topic is an expansive field evidenced by the large number of contributions published in the past few years. Hybrid photocatalysts based on inorganic semiconductors (ISs) and conjugated polymers (CPs) have emerged as novel promising photoactive materials. In addition to the well-known behaviour of ISs in photocatalytic processes, CPs have emerged as an interesting alternative to improve the photocatalytic efficiency due to the possibility of controlling their optoelectronic, textural and morphological properties at the molecular level. Thus, the synergy between ISs and CPs leads to more efficient photocatalysts with enhanced light absorption in the overall solar spectrum, improved photocharge generation and transport, higher stability to photo-corrosion and higher surface areas. Here, we present an overview of the advances in the development of hybrid IS-CP photocatalysts for pollutant degradation and energy conversion through water splitting, CO2 reduction and/or N-2 fixation using photo- and photo(electro)catalytic processes.
0D CoP cocatalyst/2D g-C3N4 nanosheets: An efficient photocatalyst for promoting photocatalytic hydrogen evolution	In this work, cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanoparticles were successfully decorated on an ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheet photocatalysts by in situ chemical deposition. The built-in electric field formed by heterojunction interface of the CoP/g-C3N4 composite semiconductor can accelerate the transmission and separation of photogenerated charge-hole pairsand effectively improve the photocatalytic performance. TEM, HRTEM, XPS, and SPV analysis showed that CoP/g-C3N4 formed a stable heterogeneous interface and effectively enhanced photogenerated electron-hole separation. UV-vis DRS analysis showed that the composite had enhanced visible light absorption than pure g-C3N4 and was a visible light driven photocatalyst. In this process, NaH2PO2 and CoCl2 are used as the source of P and Co, and typical preparation of CoP can be completed within 3hours. Under visible light irradiation, the optimal H-2 evolution rate of 3.0mol% CoP/g-C3N4 is about 15.1 mu molh(-1). The photocatalytic activity and stability of the CoP/g-C3N4 materials were evaluated by photocatalytic decomposition of water. The intrinsic relationship between the microstructure of the composite catalyst and the photocatalytic performance was analyzed to reveal the photocatalytic reaction mechanism.
Collagen species in various sized human arteries and their changes with intimal proliferation	The collagen types extracted from intermediate and small sized human arteries were investigated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) after differential salt fractionation. Limited and repeated pepsin digestion was used to prepare collagen species. Type V, IV and VI collagens were extracted greater in the former relative to in the latter, whereas type I and III collagen were extracted until the last extract. Type I collagen comprised as the major collagen in the intima of various arteries as well as in venous tissue. Type III and V collagens were found to be less in small arteries than in the initial stage of atherosclerosis. Type VI collagen in the intermediate and small arteries was detected on SDS-PAGE.
A separation-free and pizza-structure PAM/GCN/PAA composite hydrogel (PCH) in wastewater treatment at visible light or solar light	During wastewater treatment, the separation of powder nano-photocatalyst from treated water is a limiting factor for the commercial application of the powder photocatalysts. In this study, a photocatalyst, i.e. graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) was immobilized in network of polyacrylic acid (PAA) hydrogel to solve this issue. To further immobilizing GCN and strengthening hydrogel, polyacrylamide (PAM) was introduced to form interpenetrating network with PAA. In this structure, PAM acted the role of cheese in a pizza, tightly covering and immobilizing GCN into the interpenetrating network. During the cyclic tests, PCH with 20 mg (PCH20) can be successively reused 5 times compared 3 times of GCN/PAA with the RhB photodegradation efficiency over 95% each time. Meanwhile, GCN retention rates of GCN/PAA and PCH20 are 71.2 ± 5.2% and 97.2 ± 1.9% respectively. Besides, GCN played initiator role in the polymerization of PAM. PCH20 was more stable comparing with GCN/PAA hydrogel at both mechanical and thermal characterization. Furthermore, PCH20 showed excellent photocatalysis capability to RhB dyed wastewater at both visible and solar light. During 5 time's continuously cyclic tests, the photodegradation efficiency of PCH20 over RhB solution (10 mgL-1) was over 95% within 2 h under visible light (100 mWcm-2) each time. By changing pH values of solution from 3 to 9, the degree of swelling ratio (Dsw) of PCH20 could achieve from 307 ± 39% to 2361 ± 135%. PCH20 was feasible to obtain large surface area through swelling and it was beneficial for GCN to harvest the light. Hence, the photodegradation performance of PCH20 in RhB solution of pH 7, 9 was better than its in the original (pH 5.7) or the pH 3 RhB solution. The preparation of PCH20 was environmental friendly and cost-efficient without using any photoinitiators and crosslinking agents except GCN.
Biochemical studies on human ceruloplasmin	Ceruloplasmin from nephrotic urine, ascites fluid and plasma has been partially characterized. All ceruloplasmin preparations were found to be comprised of two light and two heavy polypeptide subunits. Characterization of the purified subunits indicated that the alpha chain had a mol. wt. of 16000 and had N-terminal valine while the beta chain had a mol. wt. of 59000 and had N-terminal lysine. All carbohydrate resided in the beta subunit. Incomplete cleavage of the 5-methionine residues of the alpha chain enabled a preliminary ordering of the CNBr fragments. Automated sequence analysis of the alpha chain was carried out and the sequence determined was Val-Phe-Asx-Pro-Arg-Arg-Lys-Leu-Glx-Phe-Ala-Leu-Leu-Phe-Leu-Val-Phe-Asx-Glx-Asx-Glx.
Improved photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 derived from cyanamide-urea solution	This paper describes the fabrication of g-C3N4 by the polymerization of cyanamide-urea solution at elevated temperatures. The textural properties and electronic band structure of the obtained g-C3N4 were investigated in detail. The photocatalytic activity for both oxidative and reductive reactions of the as-synthesized g-C3N4 was found to be enhanced as the polymerization temperature increase and the g-C3N4 obtained at 700 degrees C (CN-700) showed the best photocatalytic activity under visible-light (lambda > 420 nm). Considering that the rather wide band gap (3.01 eV) of CN-700 disables the electron transition from the valence band to the conduction band by visible light (l > 420 nm), it is believed the n-pi* transition, which is alternatively proposed in this study, plays a key role in its photocatalytic activity. In light of this discovery, the variation of the electron-transition mechanism for g-C3N4 fabricated at different polymerization temperatures has been firstly investigated.

Carbon nitride-based nanocaptor: An intelligent nanosystem with metal ions chelating eﬀect for enhanced magnetic targeting phototherapy of Alzheimer's disease	Metal ions imbalance, a well-established pathologic feature of alzheimer's disease (AD), ultimately results in the deposition of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) proteins and Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. Herein, to overcome these hurdles, an intelligent Aβ nanocaptor with the capacity to chelate metal ions and targeted therapy is developed by anchoring carbon nitride (C3N4) nanodots to Fe3O4@mesoporous silica nanospheres, and decorated with benzothiazole aniline (BTA) (designated as B-FeCN). The C3N4 nanodots could effectively capture superfluous Cu2+ to suppress the formation of Cu2+-Aβ complex thereby eliminating Aβ aggregation. Simultaneously, the nanocaptor enables local low-temperature hyperthermia to promote the dissolution of preformed fiber precipitates, therefore, maximizing the therapeutic benefits. Owing to its favorable photothermal effect, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of the nanocaptor is noticeably ameliorated upon laser illumination, which conquers the limitations associated with traditional anti-AD drugs, as evidenced by in vivo and in vitro studies. Besides, leveraging on the magnetic properties of Fe3O4 core, the nanocaptor is magnetized to access to the targeted Aβ regions under extrinsic magnetic field. BTA conjugation, which specifically binds to the β2 position of the Aβ fibers, executes specific targeting at Aβ plaques, and synchronously endows the BTA-modified nanocaptor with fluorescent imaging property for sensitively detecting Aβ aggregates. In view of these superiorities, nanocaptors combine metallostasis restoration and Aβ targeted therapy can surmount the interference of copper ions, enhance BBB permeability and protect cells against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity, which provides new avenues for developing neuroprotective nanosystems for the treatment of alzheimer's disease.
Toward NIR driven photocatalyst: Fabrication, characterization, and photocatalytic activity of beta-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+/g-C3N4 nanocomposite	The beta-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+/g-C3N4 (NYT/C3N4) photocatalyst has been successfully fabricated by a stepwise method. Firstly, the advanced near-infrared (NIR) driven photocatalyst was characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. It was found that NYT/C3N4 photocatalyst consisted of uniform hexagonal phase NaYF4 nanocrystals with about 20 nm diameter distributed on surface of g-C3N4 sheets, and the NYT/C3N4 composite exhibited strong near-infrared light absorption and the energy transfer from beta-NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ to g-C3N4 was confirmed. Secondly, the photocatalytic activities of the catalysts were evaluated by the degradation of methyl blue dye and colorless phenol under the irradiation of 980 nm laser. The results suggested that NYT/C3N4 nanocomposite is an advanced NIR-driven photocatalyst. Moreover the NYT/C3N4 photocatalyst showed good stability for photocatalytic decoloration of dye in the recycled tests. This study suggested a promising system to utilize the NIR energy of sunlight for photochemical and photoelectrical applications based on g-C3N4, which will contribute to the utilization of solar energy in the future.

Graphitic Carbon Nitride Microspheres Supported alpha-FeO(OH) Hybrids for Visible Light Photodegradation of MO	Graphitic carbon nitride(g-C3N4) microspheres supported alpha-FeO(OH) hybrids[alpha-FeO(OH)/g-C3N4] were prepared by means of a self-assembly method in deionized water. By UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, it has been confirmed that alpha-FeO(OH)/g-C3N4 has a wider absorption range than g-C3N4. The feature of alpha-FeO(OH)/g-C3N4 can be attributed to the efficient separation of the electron-hole pairs with photoluminescence spectra. The degradation rate of methyl orange(MO) is up to 99% under the optimal conditions of 110 min, initial concentration of 30 mg/L, an alpha-FeO(OH)/g-C3N4 dosage of 15 mg as well as visible light. The mechanism for this photocatalytic reaction was proposed, with hydroxyl radicals being a major active catalytic species.
Photoelectrochemically-assisted biofuel cell constructed by redox complex and g-C3N4 coated MWCNT bioanode	Herein, we report a membraneless glucose and air photoelectrochemical biofuel cell (PBFC) with a visible light assisted photobioanode. Flavin adenine dinucleotide dependent glucose dehydrogenase (FADGDH) was immobilized on the combined photobioanode for the visible light assisted glucose oxidation (GCE|MWCNT|g-C3N4|Ru-complex|FADGDH) with a quinone mediated electron transfer. Bilirubine oxidase (BOx) immobilized on MWCNT coated GCE (GCE|BOx) was used as the cathode with direct electron transfer (DET). An improvement of biocatalytic oxidation current was observed by 6.2% due in part to the light-driven electron-transfer. The large oxidation currents are probably owing to the good contacting of the immobilized enzymes with the electrode material and the utilization of light assisted process. Under the visible light, the photobioanode shows an anodic photocurrent of 1.95 μA cm2 at attractively low potentials viz. -0.4 vs Ag/AgCl. The lower-lying conduction band of g-C3N4 as compared to Ru-complexes decreases the rate of hole and electron recombination and enhances the charge transportation. The bioanode shows maximum current density for glucose oxidation up to 6.78 μA cm-2 at 0.2 V vs Ag/AgCl at pH:7. The performance of three promising Ru-complexes differing in chemical and redox properties were compared as electron mediators for FADGDH. Upon illumination, the PBFC delivered a maximum power density of 28.5 ± 0.10 μW cm-2 at a cell voltage of +0.4 V with an open circuit voltage of 0.64 V.
SBA-15 Templated Mesoporous Graphitic C3N4 for Remarkably Enhanced Photocatalytic Degradation of Organic Pollutants under Visible Light	Organic pollutants in water have been threatening public and environmental health. Developing efficient and sustainable photocatalysts working for degradation of organic pollutants under visible light becomes a big challenge. In this paper, high-efficiency visible light driven catalyst ordered mesoporous graphite nitride carbon (mpg-C3N4) was prepared by using SBA-15 as template and dicyandiamide (C2H4N4) as precursor. The specific surface area of mpg-C3N4 can be increased remarkably as compared to that of the bulk graphite nitrite carbon (g-C3N4) by adjusting the ratio of SBA-15 to dicyandiamide. Photocatalytic performance of mpg-C3N4 were evaluated systematically by degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB), malachite green (MG) and tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) under visible light irradiation. The results showed that the mpg-C3N4 (1 : 0.5) has the highest photocatalytic activity and stability and the degradation rate is for RhB, MG and TC are all more than seven times that of bulk g-C3N4. After five recycling runs, the mpg-C3N4 (1 : 0.5) remains high photocatalytic activities for the degradation of MG (94%) and TC (81%), respectively. Additionally, radical trapping experiments certified that the main active species are Â·O2 - and h+, while the role of Â·OH is irrelevant in the reaction processes. This work provides a promising pathway to prepare metal-free photocatalyst for degradation of organic pollutants under visible light irradiation.
Preparation of Graphite Phase C3N4 and Bismuth Based Composite Photocatalyst and Its Environmental Application	Semiconductor photocatalytic technology has been proved as an effective way to solve the problems of both environmental pollution and energy shortage. It can be applied for the degradation, transformation and mineralization of pollutants in the environment, and for the conversion of solar energy as well. Graphite phase carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and bismuth based composite materials have become the hot research topic because of their excellent photocatalytic performance. This paper reviews the preparation methods of g-C3N4 and its composites with different bismuth compounds. We also reviews the recent advances of the application of g-C3N4 and Bi composites in the environmental purification, including the elimination of pollutants in water, the light induced bacterial inactivation, and the photoinduced hydrolysis for hydrogen production. Taking the elimination of organic contaminants in water as an example, this paper elaborate detailedly their mechanisms of photocatalytic degradation. Finally, we prospect the new development and application potential of the g-C3N4 and Bi based composite photocatalytic materials in the environmental field.
2D/2D MXene/g-C3N4 for photocatalytic selective oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural into 2,5-formylfuran	The selective oxidation of 5-hydroxyfurfural (HMF) into the corresponding aldehyde is one of the key reactions in the production of chemical products. Here, we prepared the MXene/g-C3N4 composite (MX/CN) for photocatalytic selective oxidation of HMF into 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF). At the mild reaction conditions, both DFF selectivity and yield can reach up to >= 90% over 6% MX/CN. In addition, the MX/CN also shows high activity for selective oxidation of other non-aromatic and aromatic alcohols. Moreover, the reaction conditions are surveyed and the mechanism has been studied. This study provides a way for HMF conversion under mild conditions.
Carbon nitride-cerium oxide supported low-content gold catalyst for catalytic removal of formaldehyde, comprises carrier of catalyst is composite carrier carbon nitride-cerium oxide of graphite-like carbon nitride and cerium oxide	
Facile modification of a graphitic carbon nitride catalyst to improve its photoreactivity under visible light irradiation	Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has attracted much attention worldwide ever since the recent discovery of its photocatalytic activity and metal-free property. In the current study, one-step acidification of melamine, by an easy to operate and low-cost approach, is proposed to improve the photocatalytic activity of prepared ag-C3N4. Rhodamine B (rhB), a typical organic dye, was chosen as a model pollutant to verify improvement in the photocatalytic performance of acidified g-C3N4 (ag-C3N4). The results reveal that the apparent reactive rate constant (k(app)) of ag-C3N4 increases approximately three-fold under visible light at pH 7.0 compared to that of g-C3N4. Based on a systematic analysis of properties of ag-C3N4 and g-C-3/N-4, this substantial improvement in photoreactivity is mainly attributed to changes in the growth orientation of self-polycondensed sheets and surface properties by acidification treatment, which endows ag-C3N4 with a high photoreactivity.

Positioning cyanamide defects in g-C3N4: Engineering energy levels and active sites for superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution	g-C3N4 has recently emerged as a promising photocatalyst for solar energy conversion. Nonetheless, attempts to enhance its inherently low activity are rarely based on precise molecular tunability strategy. In this study, two type cyanamide defects-grafting g-C3N4 (CCN) was prepared through the thermal polymerization of thiourea in the presence of KCl. Stable potassium isothiocyanate (KSCN) was in situ generated via thiourea isomerization and then reacted with different amino groups (-NH2 and =NH) in tri-s-triazine rings to obtain two-type cyanamide defects. Theoretical calculations and experiment results confirm that the ratio of the two-type cyanamide defects could be adjusted by KCl dosage, accompanying tunable energy levels of CCN. The charge carrier transfer and separation of CCN was greatly improved. Furthermore, the existence of cyanamide defects hindered the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds among g-C3N4, which facilitated the formation of porous structure and exposed more active sites for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As a result, the optimized photocatalyst (CCN-0.03) showed a high HER rate of 4.0 mmol g(-1)h(-1), which was 5 times higher than 0.8 mmol g(-1) h(-1) for pristine g-C3N4. And the apparent quantum efficiency reached up to 14.65% at 420 +/- 10 nm. The findings deepen the understanding on precise molecular tuning of g-C3N4.
Nickel embedded in N-doped porous carbon for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to p-aminophenol in sulphuric acid	An acid-resistant catalyst composed of nickel embedded in N-doped porous carbon is developed for the catalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene (NB) to p-aminophenol (PAP). The catalyst, due to a special electron donation from nickel to the N-doped porous carbon, shows an excellent catalytic performance and stability in sulphuric acid solution.
Graphitic Carbon Nitride Nanosheets Covalently Functionalized with Biocompatible Vitamin B 1: Synthesis, Characterization, and Its Superior Performance for Synthesis of Quinoxalines	The physical properties of two-dimensional nanosheet materials make them promising candidates as active materials in the areas of photoelectronics, fuel cells, sensors, water splitting, solar energy conversion, CO2 reduction, and heterogeneous catalysis. Among two-dimensional nanosheet materials, graphitic carbon nitride due to its electronic structure and high chemical and thermal stability possesses unique properties. Covalent functionalization of graphitic carbon nitride could be the key step in modifying its ability and significantly improving its properties. To this purpose, a novel strategy for the covalent functionalization of g-C3N4 nanosheets (CN) with vitamin B1 (VB1) by using 1,3-dibromopropane as a covalent linker for the first time is demonstrated. The obtained CN-Pr-VB1 exhibits increased thermal stability compared to the VB1 which is important in the practice application and can be easily dispersed in common organic solvents. The efficacy of the CN-Pr-VB1 as a heterogeneous organocatalyst was evaluated in the quinoxaline synthesis under solvent-free conditions and afforded good isolated yield with high purity. Moreover, the prepared catalyst could be facilely recycled and reused for seven consecutive cycles without a noticeable decrease in the catalytic activity. Extensive characterization confirmed the stability of morphology and chemical structure after recyclability of the CN-Pr-VB1.
Metalloid Ni2P and its behavior for boosting the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of CaIn2S4	The development of high-efficiency and low-cost photocatalysts in photocatalytic H-2 evolution systems from water remains challenging. The substitution of a noble metal as the co-catalyst is still one of the important and meaningful issues in this field. Herein, we report a series of CaIn2S4 catalysts combined with Ni2P, which acts as the co-catalyst, for boosting photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible light. The integrated system of the Ni2P/CaIn2S4 composite exhibited high efficiency and durability, which were even higher than those of Pt decorated catalysts. The promoting effect of Ni2P can be ascribed to its excellent reductive ability and analogous metallic character, which can accelerate the transfer and consumption of the photo-generated electrons. Moreover, based on the surface photo-voltage technique and electrochemical tests, the unique mechanism of Ni2P for the movement of photo-generated charges during the photocatalysis process is proposed for the first time.

Modification of the composition of articular cartilage collagen fibrils with increasing age	Recent studies have identified a range of interactions between type IX collagen and other cartilage matrix components. To determine the extent to which these interactions are important in maintaining the integrity of ageing articular cartilage, we analyzed an age range of normal healthy articular cartilage samples by Western blotting, immunohistochemical, and PCR analyses. Reduced levels of type IX collagen were detected in post adolescence cartilage. Type IX collagen epitopes were evident throughout the matrix in all cartilage samples up to 19 years of age. Post adolescence, however, the pattern of immunoreactivity revealed territorial staining only. Type IX collagen expression at the transcriptional level is maintained at all ages. Type IX collagen fragments were extracted from young tissue, supporting the hypothesis that young cartilage is continually remodelled, while mature cartilage maintains relatively low levels of collagen turnover. Clearly the age changes we observed may have significant effects on the integrity of the tissue as the chondrocytes in ageing articular cartilage have limited capacity to turnover the interterritorial matrix. However, this study provides evidence that even in old age, the chondrocyte attempts to maintain its pericellular environment and hence its mechanical role. Therefore, the potential of type IX collagen to interact with other matrix components continues to be of importance in the territorial environment, and these interactions may have significant roles in mechanotransduction.
The complete amino acid sequence of barley trypsin inhibitor	The amino acid sequence of barley trypsin inhibitor has been determined. The protein is a single polypeptide consisting of 121 amino acid residues and has Mr = 13,305. No free sulfhydryl groups were detected by Ellman's reagent, which indicates the presence of five disulfide bridges in the molecule. The primary site of interaction with trypsin was tentatively assigned to the arginyl-leucyl residues at positions 33 and 34. On comparison of the sequence of this inhibitor with those of other proteinase inhibitors, we found that the barley trypsin inhibitor could not be classified into any of the established families of proteinase inhibitors (Laskowski, M., Jr., and Kato, I. (1980) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 49, 593-626) and that this inhibitor should represent a new inhibitor family. On the other hand, this trypsin inhibitor showed a considerable similarity to wheat alpha-amylase inhibitor (Kashlan, N., and Richardson, M. (1981) Phytochemistry (Oxf.) 20, 1781-1784) throughout the whole sequence, suggesting a common ancestry for both proteins. This is the first case of a possible evolutionary relationship between two inhibitors directed to totally different enzymes, a proteinase and a glycosidase.
Shape-controlled assemblies of graphitic carbon nitride polymer for efficient sterilization therapies of water microbial contamination via 2D g-C3N4 under visible light illumination	Bacterial pathogens of water origin have potential public threats thus suggesting the need of developing efficient and sustainable water disinfection strategies from waterborne pathogens. We set out to synthesize different controlled morphologies of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) polymer, evaluate their comparative effects on the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and investigate potential applications in water purification systems. Characterization of the synthesized microstructures of g-C3N4, such as melamine-cyanuric acid (MCA)-based rosette-type, rod-type, 2D hexagonal, and 3D cubic mesoporous silica was accomplished using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The microbial inhibitory potential of 2D g-C3N4 photocatalyst against waterborne Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella typhimurium was evaluated based on the effective activity of 2D g-C3N4 upon visible light excitations. The microbicidal efficiency of 2D g-C3N4 was evident within 30 min of visible light exposure via direct interaction, while other microstructures of g-C3N4 demonstrated only slight antimicrobial effects after 120 min, with insufficient ROS generation. The antimicrobial and ROS-generating effects of 2D g-C3N4 depended on the type and surface area of the synthesized 2D g-C3N4 material. Considering its availability and excellent disinfection activity, 2D g-C3N4 obtained from simple and convenient facile synthesis is a promising solar-driven photocatalyst for clearing microbial contamination from water.
Effects of the preparation method of Pt/g-C3N4 photocatalysts on their efficiency for visible-light hydrogen production	As a two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterial, bulk g-C3N4 (CNB) has a low specific surface area and weak electron transport ability, which limit its application in photocatalysis. In this paper, ultrathin porous g-C3N4 nanosheets (CNS) have been synthesized by thermal oxidation etching of CNB. Compared with CNB, CNS possess a larger surface area of 234.65 m2 g-1, good dispersity in water and a high electron transfer rate. As a co-catalyst, ultra-small Pt nanoparticles (NPs) with high dispersity are successfully loaded on the surface of CNS. It is found that changing the loading method of Pt NPs in the preparation step remarkably alters the efficiency for hydrogen production. The Pt/CNS-CR photocatalyst fabricated by the chemical reduction (CR) method shows a much higher efficiency for H2 evolution from water splitting, compared to the Pt/CNS-PR photocatalyst obtained by the loading of Pt NPs by the traditional photo-reduction (PR) method. When triethanolamine (TEOA) is used as a hole sacrificial agent, the hydrogen production rate of 2.0%-Pt/CNS-CR is 7862.5 μmol g-1 h-1, which is 6.92 times higher than that of 2.0%-Pt/CNS-PR (1136.8 μmol g-1 h-1). The valence states of the Pt element in the Pt/CNS-CR and Pt/CNS-PR nanocomposites have been analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. At the same time, the effects of the loading amount of Pt and different sacrificial reagents on the photocatalytic H2 generation activity have also been systematically investigated.
Fabrication of Co(Ni)-P surface bonding states on core-shell Co(OH)(2)@P-NiCo-LDH towards electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction	The application of NiCo-LDHs in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is rarely reported because it is usually served as an effective electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) owing to the essential chemical and electric structure features. It still is a challenge to realize the effective HER over NiCo-LDHs unless modified with noble metals. In this work, the noble-metal-free core-shell Co(OH)(2)@P-NiCo-LDH hybrid with dodecahedral hierarchical structure is prepared by the sacrificial template method along with subsequent phosphating process, which is available for the electrocatalytic HER. The fabricated Co(Ni)(delta+)-P delta- bonding states on the surface of outer shell NiCo-LDH not only provide the abundant active centers but also reduce interfacial charge transfer resistance to enhance the HER activity. Meanwhile, the unique core-shell dodecahedral structure effectively avoids the agglomeration and restacking of NiCo-LDH nanosheets to improve the electrochemical stability. This work exploits a novel noble-metal-free modification strategy to expand the application of NiCo-LDH in HER. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
Ni, Pd, and Pt-embedded graphitic carbon nitrides as excellent adsorbents for HCN removal: A DFT study	In this work, we studied transition metals (abbreviated as TM, including Ni, Pd, and Pt) embedded graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) for adsorption of HCN gas using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results indicated that upon adsorption of HCN gas, the initial planar structures of the pure g-C3N4 and TM-embedded g-C3N4 systems (except Ni-embedded g-C3N4) are changing and the structures become corrugated. Furthermore, it was found that the d-orbitals of TM atoms hybridize with the p-orbitals of g-C3N4, leading to decrease of the band gap energy for the embedded systems when compared with the pure g-C3N4. In addition, our results of polarized band structure plots revealed that the asymmetry between the majority spin and minority spin branches of the Pt-embedded g-C3N4 give rise to spontaneous magnetization of this system with a net magnetic moment of about 1.35 mu B. Among the applied systems, the Pt-embedded g-C3N4 displayed substantially enhanced adsorption energy relative to the pure g-C3N4 (-0.297 eV), which is -1.98 eV. To the best of our knowledge the Pt-embedded g-C3N4 displayed the highest affinity for adsorption of HCN gas among the proposed adsorbents. Thus, the Pt-embedded g-C3N4 could be a low cost and an excellent candidate for sensing HCN gas and its removal from the atmosphere.
A trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitor from chick peas (Cicer arietinum)	1. A trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitor was isolated by extraction of chick-pea meal at pH8.3, followed by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation and successive column chromatography on CM-cellulose and calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite). 2. The inhibitor was pure by polyacrylamide-gel and cellulose acetate electrophoresis and by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gels. 3. The inhibitor had a molecular weight of approx. 10000 as determined by ultracentrifugation and by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate. A molecular weight of 8300 was resolved from its amino acid composition. 4. The inhibitor formed complexes with trypsin and chymotrypsin at molar ratios of 1:1. 5. Limited proteolysis of the inhibitor with trypsin at pH3.75 resulted in hydrolysis of a single-Lys-X-bond and in consequent loss of 85% of the trypsin inhibitory activity and 60% of the chymotrypsin inhibitory activity. Limited proteolysis of the inhibitor with chymotrypsin at pH3.75 resulted in hydrolysis of a single-Tyr-X-bond and in consequent loss of 70% of the trypsin inhibitory activity and in complete loss of the chymotrypsin inhibitory activity. 6. Cleavage of the inhibitor with CNBr followed by pepsin and consequent separation of the products on a Bio Gel P-10 column, yielded two active fragments, A and B. Fragment A inhibited trypsin but not chymotrypsin, and fragment B inhibited chymotrypsin but not trypsin. The specific trypsin inhibitory activity, on a molar ratio, of fragment A was twice that of the native inhibitor, suggesting the unmasking of another trypsin inhibitory site as a result of the cleavage. On the other hand, the specific chymotrypsin inhibitory activity of fragment B was about one-half of that of the native inhibitor, indicating the occurrence of a possible conformational change.
Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)-Pt-TiO2 nanocomposite as an efficient photocatalyst for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation	Porous graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was prepared by a simple pyrolysis of urea, and then a g-C3N4-Pt-TiO(2) nanocomposite was fabricated via a facile chemical adsorption followed by a calcination process. The obtained products were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra, and electron microscopy. It is found that the visible-light-induced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate can be remarkably enhanced by coupling TiO(2) with the above g-C3N4, and the g-C3N4-Pt-TiO(2) composite with a mass ratio of 70 : 30 has the maximum photoactivity and excellent photostability for hydrogen production under visible-light irradiation, and the stable photocurrent of g-C3N4-TiO(2) is about 1.5 times higher than that of the bare g-C3N4. The above experimental results show that the photogenerated electrons of g-C3N4 can directionally migrate to Pt-TiO(2) due to the close interfacial connections and the synergistic effect existing between Pt-TiO(2) and g-C3N4 where photogenerated electrons and holes are efficiently separated in space, which is beneficial for retarding the charge recombination and improving the photoactivity.
In Situ Grown Agl/Bi12O17Cl2 Heterojunction Photocatalysts for Visible Light Degradation of Sulfamethazine: Efficiency, Pathway, and Mechanism	Visible-light-driven photocatalysts attract great interest because they can utilize more sunlight for reactions than conventional photocatalysts. A novel visible-light-driven photocatalyst AgI/Bismuth oxychloride (Bi12O17Cl2) hybrid was synthesized by a hydrothermal-precipitation method. Several characterization tools, such as X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) were employed to study the phase structures, morphologies, and optical properties of the fabricated photocatalysts. These characterizations indicated that AgI nanoparticles were evenly distributed on the surface of Bi12O17Cl2, and heterostructures were formed. The photochemical characterizations demonstrated that the promoted separation of carrier transfer in the AgI/Bi12O17Cl2 heterojunction was achieved. The degradation rate of sulfamethazine (SMZ) by AgI/Bi12O17Cl2 was about 7.8 times and 35.2 times higher than that of pristine Bi12O17Cl2 and BiOCl under visible-light-driven photocatalysts, respectively. It was also found that the amount of AgI in the AgI/Bi12O17Cl2 composites played an important role in photocatalytic activity, and the optimized ratio was 25%. The AgI/Bi12O17Cl2 shows good catalytic stability and maintains similar reactivity after four cycles. Furthermore, the degradation intermediates of SMZ were identified by HPLC-MS, and the photocatalytic mechanism was proposed. These findings highlight the role of Bi12O17Cl2 on contaminant elimination and open avenues for the rational design of highly efficient photocatalysts.
Immunoaffinity purification and characterization of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)B receptor from bovine cerebral cortex	We developed a novel method for immunoaffinity purification of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAB) receptor from bovine cerebral cortex using a monoclonal antibody, which specifically recognizes an 80-kDa GABA-binding protein (Nakayasu, H., Mizutani, H., Hanai, K., Kimura, H., and Kuriyama, K. (1992) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 182, 722-726). The GABA binding activity in the solubilized synaptic membrane preparation was adsorbed on the antibody-conjugated beads and was eluted as a single protein band of 80 kDa by an acidic buffer, pH 2.5. The purified preparation mimicked the GABAB receptor in its binding activity for GABA, baclofen (GABAB receptor agonist) and 2-hydroxysaclofen (a GABAB receptor antagonist). The purified preparation was reconstituted with partially purified GTP-binding protein and an adenylylcyclase preparation on a phospholipid membrane. On addition of GABA or baclofen to the reconstituted membrane, the adenylylcyclase activity was inhibited, and this inhibition was antagonized by 2-hydroxysaclofen. Moreover, this inhibition by GABA was not observed in a system reconstituted system without either the 80-kDa GABA-binding protein or the GTP-binding protein. These results are strong evidence that the 80-kDa antigenic protein is the GABAB receptor. This is the first report of the nearly complete purification of the GABAB receptor.
A Potentiometric Addressable Photoelectrochemical Biosensor for Sensitive Detection of Two Biomarkers	It is a great challenge to fabricate multiplex and convenient photoelectrochemical biosensors for ultrasensitive determination of biomarkers. Herein, a fascinating potentiometric addressable photoelectrochemical biosensor was reported for double biomarkers' detection by varying the applied bias in the detection process. In this biosensor, the nanocomposite of cube anatase TiO2 mesocrystals and polyamidoamine dendrimers modified a dual disk electrode as an excellent photoelectrochemical sensing matrix. Subsequently, two important biomarkers in serum for prostate cancer, prostate-specific antigen and human interleukin-6, were immobilized onto the different disks of modified electrode via glutaraldehyde bridges. Then another two photosensitizers, graphitic-carbon-nitride-labeled and CS-AgI-labeled different antibodies, were self-assembled onto the electrode surface by a corresponding competitive immune recognition reaction. The change in photocurrent with the target antigen concentration at different critical voltages enables us to selectively and quantitatively determine targets. The results demonstrated that this potentiometric addressable photoelectrochemical biosensing strategy not only has great promise as a new point-of-care diagnostic tool for early detection of prostate cancer but also can be conveniently expanded to multiplex biosensing by simply change biomarkers. More importantly, this work provides an unambiguous operating guideline of multiplex photoelectrochemical immunoassay.
Tetra(amino)methanes: Implications of their structure and reactivity pattern for hypothetical carbon nitride frameworks	Because of their possible role as model compounds for the structural units of carbon nitride C3N4, the preparation, structural chemistry, and some representative reactions of tetra(amino)methanes have been (re)investigated. In the crystal, C(NMe2)(4) (1) has a molecular geometry close to D-2d symmetry as proposed by theoretical calculations using state-of-the-art density functional methods. The coordination of the central carbon atom is distorted tetrahedral and the configuration of the nitrogen atoms is strongly pyramidal, as opposed to almost planar in the tetra(amino)silanes. Tetra(pyrrolidinyl)methane has a similar core structure, with all heterocyclic substituents in an envelop conformation flexible in solution. Tetra (piperidinyl)methane is more rigid in solution, owing to a more congested structure, with much higher inversion barbers for the six-membered rings. Hydrolysis of 1 leads to Me2NH and hexamethylguanidinium hydroxide, and treatment of 1 with HAuCl4(aq) affords crystalline [C(NMe2)(3)](+) AuCl4-, the structure of which has also been determined. Compound 1 is a strong nucleophile and can be used as an aminating agent, converting e.g. halosilanes into dimethyl-aminosilanes, with the guanidinium cation as the leaving group. The experimental results are discussed in the light of recent predictions regarding bulk carbon nitrides.
Complexation which facilitates rejoining of horse cytochrome c apofragment [Homoser-lactone65](1-65) or [Homoser-lactone65] (23-65) to apofragment (66-104)	We have shown that two CNBr fragments of horse apocytochrome c, [Homoser-lactone65](1-65) and (66-104), bind to the ferric heme fragment (1-25)H to form a non-productive three-fragment complex, and that when the heme of this complex has been kept reduced for 48 h at 25 degrees, the peptide bond between residues 65 and 66 is restored with a yield of 24% or more. We have also shown that another CNBr fragment [Homoser-lactone65](23-65), but not [Homoser-lactone65](39-65), similarly rejoins to fragment (66-104) in the presence of the ferrous heme fragment with 25% or more yield. For complex of ferro-heme fragment [Hse-lacton65](1-65)H and apofragment (66-104) of horse cytochrome c, which restores the peptide bond between residues 65 and 66 (located on the left side of the heme) (cf. Harbury, H.A. (1978) in Semisynthetic Peptides and Proteins (Offord, R.E. & DiBello, C., eds.), pp. 73-89, Academic Press, New York). Corradin & Harbury have suggested that axial ligation of methionine 80 to the heme (on the left side) is important. Consistent with their idea, fragment [Hse80](66-104) was found not to link to [Hse-lactone65](1-65) in the presence of ferro(1-25)H. Furthermore, the present studies indicate that the interaction involving residues 26 to 38 (on the right side) is also important for such a conformation which assists in the rejoining of the two apofragments. Combining these two ideas, we suggest that restoration of the peptide bond between residues 65 and 66 reflects the structural integrity of these complexes in the reduced form. Thus, the present reaction system can be used not only for chemical synthesis of [Homoser65] apocytochrome c but also to extend amino acid substitution studies of cytochrome c to residues 1 to 64.
Graphitic carbon nitride nanostructures: Catalysis	The graphitic carbon nitride nanocomposites which possess a graphite-like layered structure have been widely attracted much attention in some applications due to their remarkable catalytic properties. Recent studies have made a surprising breakthrough in developing by adjusting materials and synthesis methods. In this review, the types of graphitic carbon nitride nanostructures and methods used in the synthesis are introduced thoroughly. The various characterization means are systematically summarized and their functions are also clearly explained. Particularly, the outstanding merits of applying graphitic carbon nitride nanocomposites in applications are described by introducing their roles in promoting catalytic reactions efficiency, which are revealed specifically by researching oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), measurement of the gas sensing properties, nitrogen photofixations reactions, degradation of CO2, NOx, 2-propanol, degradation of organic pollutants and photoreduction removal of Cr(VI).

Facile fabrication of sandwich-like BiOI/AgI/g-C3N4 composites for efficient photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange and reduction of Cr(VI)	Construction of heterojunction photocatalyst with excellent charge separation has attracted significant attention for solving the global energy crisis and environmental problems. Herein, a series of sandwich-structured BiOI/AgI/g-C3N4 composites were fabricated by a novel and facile method. The AgI was employed as a charge transmission bridge between BiOI and g-C3N4, which could result in more efficient charge transfer and better separation of charge carriers. The results indicated that the BiOI/AgI/g-C3N4 composites exhibited higher photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methyl orange (MO) and reduction of Cr(VI) than that of pure g-C3N4, BiOI, and BiOI/g-C3N4. The amount of AgI had a remarkable influence on the photocatalytic activity of the BiOI/AgI/g-C3N4 composites. Moreover, the BiOI/AgI/g-C3N4 composites exhibited high stability. Finally, a possible reaction mechanism on degradation of MO and reduction of Cr(VI) solutions over the composites was proposed. This work could facilitate a better understanding on the charge transfer process in the composite systems as well as provide a new approach to the rational design of novel advanced materials for practical photocatalytic application.
Low cost red mud modified graphitic carbon nitride for the removal of organic pollutants in wastewater by the synergistic effect of adsorption and photocatalysis	The red mud/g-C3N4 (RM-CN) composite was directly prepared via one-step thermal polymerization method using melamine and industrial waste residue (red mud) as raw materials. Under the synergistic effect of adsorption and photocatalysis, RM-CN composites have a significant effect for the removal of organic pollutants from wastewater. Compared with pure CN, the specific surface area of RM-CN has been significantly enhanced with the introduction of RM. Additionality, the optical absorption and photocurrent response exhibit obvious enhancement with respect to RM-CN as compared with that of pristine CN photocatalyst. The optimized 0.8% RM-CN product (with the RM mass content of 0.8 wt% in precursor) displayed referable photocatalytic degradation efficiency for antibiotics and dyes under visible light, as well as excellent recycle performance. This work poses a great potential in the actual wastewater treatment, and it is of great significance to the resource utilization and the cost saving of the raw material.
Graphitic Carbon Nitride Isotype Heterostructures with Enhanced Visible Photocatalytic Properties	In this work, highly active graphitic carbon nitride composite photocatalysts with an isotype heterojunction semiconductor structure have been prepared through the molecular composite precursors consisting of urea and melamine. These photocatalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, UV-Vis, BET and transient photocurrent responses. The photodegradation of dyes in aqueous solution under visible-light irradiation has been investigated over carbon nitride photocatalysts consisting of different urea/melamine mass ratios. Further studies by photocurrent indicate that the photosynergistic effect of isotype heterojunction can remarkably enhance the photoinduced interfacial charge transfer, thereby increasing the charge separation during the photocatalytic reaction.
Sequence variability in the retinal-attachment domain of mammalian rhodopsins	Ovine rhodopsin was regenerated with 11-cis-[15-3H]retinal and cleaved in situ by Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteinase to give two membrane-bound fragments of Mr 27 000 (V8-L) and 12 000 (V8-S). After purification of the proteolysed complex by affinity chromatography with concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B, [3H]retinal was covalently linked to the protein by reduction with borohydride. The purified [3H]-retinyl V8-S fragment was cleaved with CNBr and trifluoroacetic acid, the resulting peptides resolved by gel filtration and the [3H]retinyl peptide sequenced. The protocol developed for the isolation and sequencing of this region of the ovine protein was applied directly, and reproducibly, to bleached and unregenerated porcine and equine opsins. Comparisons of the primary structures of the fragments reveals marked variation in the sequence immediately after the lysine residue shown in the ovine protein to be the attachment point for the aldehyde group of the chromophore. Mutable positions are localized in regions previously predicted as adopting nonregular or distorted conformations and hint at structural arrangements that may provide a better understanding of the spectral and functional properties of the visual pigment.
Tuning the structure and composition of graphite-phase polymeric carbon nitride/reduced graphene oxide composites towards enhanced lithium-sulfur batteries performance	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been attractive alternatives to lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries due to the high theoretical capacity of sulfur cathode. However, the polysulfide shuttling effect is detrimental to the long-term cycling stability. Chemically absorptive host materials provide an effective way to mitigate the dissolution of lithium polysulfide. Carbon nitride (C3N4) is one of the effective host materials with strong interaction with polysulfide species. The low electronic conductivity, however, is unfavorable for high sulfur utilization. In this work, we report the controlled synthesis of porous, well-interconnected C3N4/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) aerogels as hybrid sulfur host using a simple hydrothermal reaction followed by freeze-drying, which combines the structural merits of both highly conductive rGO networks and chemically active C3N4. By further tuning the structure/morphology and the ratio between C3N4 and rGO, we have demonstrated the C3N4/rGO composites with optimized 1: 2 ratio of C3N4: rGO (termed as CG12) exhibits not only very high sulfur utilization but also excellent rate capability compared to other C3N4/rGO composites, pure rGO, and C3N4. The compositionally and structurally tailored CG12 also shows stable cycling performance over 400 cycles with a low decay rate of 0.09% per cycle. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Simultaneous construction of dual-site phosphorus modified g-C3N4 and its synergistic mechanism for enhanced visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution	Band structure regulation and the improvement of the carrier separation efficiency represent two important factors in relation to photocatalytic activity. Thus, the simultaneous construction of the structure and the surface of a photocatalyst would serve to address both issues. In light of the special redox property of ammonium hypophosphite, dual-site phosphorus-modified graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) photocatalysts were designed in the present study. In contrast to pristine g-C3N4 and to traditional single-site phosphorus doping, the dual-site phosphorus-modified g-C3N4 showed an apparent increase in photocatalytic H-2 evolution. The characterization results showed that the P modification existed in two forms, namely substitution of P atoms for C atoms and the surface PeN bond. In-depth analyses of the structure-activity relationship suggested that dual-site doping can regulate the band structure of g-C3N4, promote the charge-transfer rate, and further, improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers. The findings of this study could provide new insights concerning the design of dual-site phosphorus-modified photocatalysts with a regulated band structure and surface state, which could represent a promising strategy for use in the field of solar energy conversion.
UV-Assisted Cataluminescent Sensor for Carbon Monoxide Based on Oxygen-Functionalized g-C3N4 Nanomaterials	Cataluminescence (CTL) is one of the most important sensing-transduction principles for the real-time monitoring of atmospheric pollutants. Highly sensitive CTL-based CO detection still remains a challenge because of the relatively poor reactivity of CO and the low catalytic efficiency of the catalysts. Herein, combining ultraviolet (UV)-light activation and chemical modification of the sensing element, we have successfully established a UV-assisted CTL sensor for gaseous CO based on g-C3N4 with high sensitivity, selectivity, and stability. UV irradiation can efficiently activate CO molecules and induce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) for CO oxidation. Furthermore, carboxyl groups greatly facilitate the chemisorption of CO on functionalized g-C3N4 nanomaterials, thus enhancing the CTL sensitivity. The influences of experimental conditions and the possible catalytic mechanism of CO on functionalized g-C3N4 have been investigated in detail. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the proposed CTL sensor presents a detection limit (3σ) toward CO of 0.008 μg mL-1, which is much lower than the maximum allowable emission concentration of CO in atmospheric conditions (0.030 μg mL-1). The UV-CTL system is green, sensitive, stable, and low cost, and thus it possesses great potential application in gas sensing.
Metal-organic framework (MOF) composite materials for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction under visible light	The tridentate ligand 2,4,6-tris(2-(pyridin-4-yl)vinyl)-1,3,5-triazine (TPVT) was designed and synthesized. We prepared metal-organic framework (TPVT-MOFs) crystals containing TPVT, 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid and cobalt by solvothermal reaction. Then, a series of composite materials with different contents of TPVT-MOFs were obtained by combining TPVT-MOFs with g-C3N4. Due to the interaction between TPVT-MOFs and g-C3N4, the composite materials have a more favorable valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 and oxidation of H2O. Under the conditions of visible light and a gas-solid system without a co-catalyst, a photosensitizer and a sacrificial agent, the yield of CO2 reduction by TPVT-MOFs@g-C3N4-10 can reach 56.4 μmol·g-1·h-1, which is 3.2 times that of pure g-C3N4 (17.5 μmol·g-1·h-1). The results of DFT calculations showed that the adsorption of H2O on the TPVT-MOFs@g-C3N4 composite material was more preferential, which promoted the adsorption and reduction of CO2.
Graphitic carbon nitride catalyzes selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane	
The amino acid sequence of -crystallin (fraction II) from calf lens	The amino acid sequence of gamma-crystallin (fraction II) from calf lens has been determined; this indicates it to be a single-chain polypeptide of 165 amino acid residues.
Polyoxometalates-derived metal oxides incorporated into graphitic carbon nitride framework for photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide production under visible light	The hybrid catalyst of g-C3N4-PWO has been prepared through the calcination of the g-C3N4 precursor of dicyandiamide and the polyoxometalates (POMs) precursor of (NH4)(3)PW12O40 (NH4-PW12). The hybrid catalyst of g-C3N4-PWO with well-defined and stable structure exhibits efficient catalytic performance for photocatalytic H2O2 production in the absence of organic electron donor under visible light. The value of electron transfer during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process obtained from the Koutecky-Levich plot for g-C3N4-PWO (n = 1.73) is higher than that for g-C3N4 (n = 1.29), suggesting that the PWO incorporated into g-C3N4 framework can promote the electrons generation. The p-benzoquinone (PBQ) scavenger experiments, the electron spin resonance (ESR) signal and quantitative experiment of superoxide radicals (O-center dot(2)-) results reveal that the negative shifts of the conduction band (CB) level from g-C3N4 to g-C3N4-PWO can enhance the single-electron reduction of O-2 to O-center dot(2)- and further promote the sequential two-step single-electron O-2 reduction reaction to H2O2.

Determination of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP)-bonding sites in proteins: a peptide mass fingerprinting approach based on diagnostic tandem mass spectral features of PLP-modified peptides	Peptides modified by pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP), linked to a lysine residue via reductive amination, exhibit distinct spectral characteristics in the collision-induced dissociation (CID) tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra that are described here. The MS/MS spectra typically display two dominant peaks whose m/z values correspond to neutral losses of [H3PO4] (-98 Da) and the PLP moiety as [C8H10NO5P] (-231 Da) from the precursor peptide ion, respectively. Few other peaks are observed. Recognition of this distinct fragmentation behavior is imperative since determining sequences and sites of modifications relies on the formation of amide backbone cleavage products for subsequent interpretation via proteome database searching. Additionally, PLP-modified peptides exhibit suppressed precursor ionization efficiency which diminishes their detection in complex mixtures. Presented here is a protocol which describes an enrichment strategy for PLP-modified peptides combined with neutral loss screening and peptide mass fingerprinting to map the PLP-bonding site in a known PLP-dependent protein. This approach represents an efficient alternative to site-directed mutagenesis which has been the traditional method used for PLP-bonding site localization in proteins.
Synthesis, Crystal Structure, and Selected Properties of [Au(S2CNH2)(2)]SCN: A Precursor for Gold Macro-Needles Consisting of Gold Nanoparticles Glued by Graphitic Carbon Nitride	A new preparation route is developed for the synthesis of needle-like crystals of [Au(S2CNH2)(2)] SCN, which avoids disproportionation of the AuI salt used as a starting material. In the crystal structure, the two crystallographically independent AuIII centers are in a square-planar environment of two S2CNH2 ligands. The Hirshfeld surface analysis reveals the presence of noncovalent intermolecular S...S interactions, which are essential for the spatial arrangement of the molecules. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations including dispersion and damping corrections result in a unit cell volume very close to the value determined experimentally. Thermal decomposition in an inert atmosphere generates black needles with lengths of up to 500 mu m. X-ray powder diffraction and pair distribution function analyses demonstrate that the needles are composed of nanosized crystals with a volume-weighted average domain size of 20(1) nm. According to results of X-ray photoemission experiments, the black needles are covered by a nitrogen-rich carbon nitride with composition near (CN)(2)N.C-13 solid-state NMR investigations indicate that two different carbon species are present, with signals corresponding well to heptazine units as in melon and triazine units as in poly(triazin imide) type compounds. Scanning transmission electron microscopy tomography evidences that the needles are composed of slightly elongated nanoparticles.
Supported monoatomic rhodium-based catalyst comprises carrier i.e., two-dimensional ultra-thin graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets, and active component supported on carrier	
Identification and primary structure of the cardiolipin-binding domain of mitochondrial creatine kinase	It was recently shown that the mitochondrial isozyme of heart creatine kinase binds to cardiolipin on the outer half of the inner membrane [Müller, M., et al. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 3839-3843]. The enzyme has now been extracted and purified to homogeneity from rat heart mitochondria, and cleaved with CNBr. The fragments have been separated on an FPLC system using a Mono Q HR 5/5 column. Only one of these binds to cardiolipin-containing liposomes and has thus been identified as the cardiolipin-binding domain of the enzyme. Its amino acid sequence has been determined. The fragment contains 25 amino acids and corresponds to the N-terminal region of the protein. The binding of the fragment of cardiolipin-containing liposomes was inhibited by adriamycin. Another and larger CNBr fragment could be specifically labelled with periodate-oxidized (di-aldehyde) ATP and has thus been identified as the ATP-binding domain. Chemical modification of the basic amino acids Lys and Arg of the enzyme abolished its binding to cardiolipin.
Defective graphitic carbon nitride synthesized by controllable co-polymerization with enhanced visible light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution	Defects have a vital effect on the band structures and properties of semiconductor photocatalysts. Herein, we developed a one-step strategy to introduce defects in the framework of g-C3N4 by controllable copolymerization of melamine with a series of partially reactive end capped monomers. The capping molecules have great impacts on the properties of modified g-C3N4. The obtained defective g-C3N4 exhibits an increased surface area, improved charge carrier separation efficiency, and a narrowed band gap with a negative shift of the conduction band. Particularly, defect-rich CN-DPT shows 10 times improvement of visible light activity for hydrogen production compared with pristine g-C3N4.
Porous C3N4 nanolayers@N-graphene films as catalyst electrodes for highly efficient hydrogen evolution	Pt-free electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with high activity and low price are desirable for many state-of-the-art renewable energy devices, such as water electrolysis and photoelectrochemical water splitting cells. However, the design and fabrication of such materials remain a significant challenge. This work reports the preparation of a flexible three-dimensional (3D) film by integrating porous C3N4 nanolayers with nitrogen-doped graphene sheets, which can be directly utilized as HER catalyst electrodes without substrates. This nonmetal electrocatalyst has displayed an unbeatable HER performance with a very positive onset-potential close to that of commercial Pt (8 mV vs 0 mV of Pt/C, vs RHE @ 0.5 mA cm(-2)), high exchange current density of 0.43 mA cm(-2), and remarkable durability (seldom activity loss >5000 cycles). The extraordinary HER performance stems from strong synergistic effect originating from (i) highly exposed active sites generated by introduction of in-plane pores into C3N4 and exfoliation of C3N4 into nanosheets, (ii) hierarchical porous structure of the hybrid film, and (iii) 3D conductive graphene network.
Covalent immobilization of unilamellar liposomes in gel beads for chromatography	For immobilized (proteo)liposome chromatography, unilamellar liposomes were covalently bound within gel beads that had been activated by CNBr, N-hydroxysuccinimide, tresyl, or chloroformate. Liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and 2 mol% of amino-containing lipid (phosphatidylethanolamine-caproylamine) were immobilized in the activated gels at 5-35 micromol lipid/ml gel and yields of 11-70%. The highest immobilized amount was found in chloroformate-activated TSK G6000PW gel, which contains large pore size (>100 nm). Liposomes composed of PC alone could also be attached to the chloroformate-activated gels at 33-42 micromol/ml gel and yields of 58-65%, probably by crosslinking of the phosphate moiety of phospholipid with the active group of the adsorbent. Liposomes prepared by various phospholipids with or without amino-containing lipids can generally be immobilized in the chloroformate-activated gels. The covalently bound liposomes were characterized by their high stability, unilamellarity, permeability of the membranes, and drug-membrane partition properties. A stable membrane phase was constructed for chromatographic experiments to be performed under extreme elution conditions.
In-situ growth of Zn-AgIn5S8 quantum dots on g-C3N4 towards 0D/2D heterostructured photocatalysts with enhanced hydrogen production	Photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production represents an ideal pathway for solar energy harvesting and conversion, for which narrow bandgap multinary sulfides play an important role. Here, series of Zn-AgIn5S8/g-C3N4 0D/2D nanocomposites were prepared by in-situ growth of the Zn AgIn5S8 quantum dots (QDs) on g-C3N4 nanosheets for improved charge separation. To our surprise, rather than a photoactive component, here g-C3N4 nanosheets act as a charge transfer mediator, where only a relatively low ratio is required. The as-fabricated Zn-AgIn5S8/g-C3N4 nanocomposites were systematically studied. When the mass ratio of g-C3N4 was 10%, the hydrogen production rate was maximized, which was 1.39 times higher than pure Zn-AgIn5S8 QDs and 138.6 times higher than g-C3N4. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the Zn-AgIn5S8/g-C3N4 nanocomposites is attributed to the intimate interface contact, which results in the effective separation and transfer of the photogenerated charge carriers as proved by the PL lifetime, transient photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectra measurements. The Zn-AgIn5S8/g-C3N4 nano-composites also exhibit excellent cycle stability. A plausible mechanism was proposed for the 0D/2D Zn-AgIn5S8/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts. This work provides a relatively simple method for constructing high-quality 0D/2D heterostructure of QDs/nanosheets, as well as new insight for the efficiency improvement of narrow-bandgap sulfide photocatalysts.

Black phosphorus/graphitic carbon nitride composite visible light photocatalytic material used for degradation of organic pollutant comprises black phosphorus and graphitic carbon nitride	
Boron- and phenyl-codoped graphitic carbon nitride with greatly enhanced light responsive range for photocatalytic disinfection	The development of metal-free photocatalyst to make maximum use of the solar energy for photocatalytic disinfection is highly desired. Herein, boron-and phenyl-codoped graphitic carbon nitride was prepared by thermal polycondensation of cyanamide with 3-aminobenzeneboronic acid and applied as photocatalyst to inactivate Escherichia coli (E. coli). The photocatalysts exhibited the enhanced light responsive range over ultraviolet to near infrared light and 99.9% bacteria could be inactivated within 3 h with a low concentration of photocatalyst under the irradiation of simulated solar light. The disinfection mechanism was studied by scavenger experiments, indicating H2O2 was the main reactive species for the inactivation of bacteria. Finally, the photocatalyst was deposited on the surface of solid material and also exhibited strong disinfection performance. Taking advantage of excellent disinfection activity and low cytotoxicity, the photocatalyst showed a promising application in solar-driven photocatalytic disinfection in public place.
Induction of ovalbumin-specific cytotoxic T cells by in vivo peptide immunization	CTL recognize peptide forms of processed, foreign antigens in association with class I molecules encoded by the MHC and are usually directed against endogenously synthesized "cellular antigens," such as those expressed by virus-infected cells. In vitro studies have shown that small exogenous peptides can directly associate with class I molecules on the cell surface and mimic the target complex derived by intracellular processing and presentation. We have recently generated OVA-specific, H-2Kb-restricted CTL by immunizing C57BL/6 mice with a syngeneic tumor line transfected with the OVA cDNA. The CTL recognize the OVA transfectant E.G7-OVA and the synthetic peptide OVA258-276, but fail to recognize the native protein. We reasoned that given the potential for direct peptide/class I association observed in vitro, OVA258-276 may induce CTL after in vivo priming. However, we found that this is not the case. OVA258-276 and peptides of increasing lengths up to OVA242-276 and OVA242-285, which are all able to form the target complex in vitro, are inefficient at priming E.G7-OVA-specific CTL responses after intravenous injection. This is also true for both native and denatured OVA. In contrast to these results the synthetic peptide OVA229-276 corresponding to a peptide in a partial tryptic digestion of OVA can efficiently prime C57BL/6 mice in vivo after intravenous injection. This peptide elicits CTL that appear identical to those derived from animals immunized with syngeneic cells producing OVA endogenously. These results are discussed in terms of separate class I and class II antigen presentation pathways and the ability of only certain, exogenous antigens to enter the cytoplasmic, class I pathway.
Recover of C3N4 nanoparticles under high-pressure by shock wave loading	Theory predicts that beta-C3N4 with its dense structure is a superhard material. In order to synthesize this material, light-gas gun loading and shock recovery technology were used to perform experiments. The amorphous nitrogen-enriched g-C3N4, produced by the thermal decomposition of melamine, was used as a precursor. The shock synthesis experiment was completed under the pressure of 50 GPa. A high-density phase with a beta-C3N4 structure was detected only in the desired product. It is suspected that the elemental composition and synthetic pressure of precursors may be the main factors affecting the phase composition of products. This has significant potential for the synthesis of pure superhard carbonitride compounds.
Photocatalytic activity enhancement of core-shell structure g-C3N4@TiO2 via controlled ultrathin g-C3N4 layer	The g-C3N4@TiO2 core-shell structure photocatalysts with controlled ultrathin g-C3N4 layer (0 nm, 1.0 nm, 1.5 nm, 3.0 nm) were prepared by a new method of the sol-gel approaches in situ coating re-assembled. The g-C3N4@TiO2 sample with 1.0 nm thickness of shell layers has the highest visible light photocatalytic degradation phenol activity which is almost 7.2 times as high as that of bulk g-C3N4. The highest photocurrent response intensity is increased by ten times higher than that of g-C3N4 and five orders of magnitude compare to TiO2. The removal rate of phenol using g-C3N4@TiO2 core-shell catalyst is 30% and the degree of mineralization by the same catalyst is 19.8%, which dramatically increase compared with that of g-C3N4 and TiO2. The enhanced performance of the degradation phenol and the mineralization is owing to effective charge separation revealed by the photoluminescence (PL), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and density functional theory calculations (DFT), superoxide radicals as the main oxidative species proved by electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR). And the core-shell structure could effectively promote the electron transfer from g-C3N4 to TiO2 during the catalytic process. The results of repetitive experiment and cycle experiment show that the g-C3N4@TiO2 has a strong binding force between the core and shell, which is stable, without secondary pollution and convenient for recovery. What's more, the results revealed the law between the different g-C3N4 shell layers (0 nm, 1.0 nm, 1.5 nm, 3.0 nm) over the g-C3N4@TiO2 samples and the corresponding catalytic activity, which successfully established the structure-activity relationship. A new catalytic concept namely layer-dependent effect was found, that is number of layers over g-C3N4 of the core-shell structure determines photocatalytic activity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Noble metal-free 0D-1D NiS x/CdS nanocomposites toward highly efficient photocatalytic contamination removal and hydrogen evolution under visible light	The development of stable noble metal-free photocatalysts with efficient separation and transportation of the photogenerated electrons-holes is of crucial importance for promoting the application of photocatalysis technology. Herein, we propose an electron transfer strategy by reasonable design and fabrication of novel 0D NiSx nanosheets as a co-catalyst on the surface of 1D CdS nanorods (CdS-NRs) to enhance photocatalytic hydrogen evaluation and contamination (Cr(vi), rhodamine B and bisphenol A) removal in water. Under visible light irradiation, the 0D-1D NiSx/CdS-NR nanocomposite with 1.5% NiSx loading gave a hydrogen evolution rate of 5.98 mmol h-1 g-1, which is about 5.3 times and 1.9 times higher than that of the native CdS-NRs and the optimal 1% Pt/CdS-NRs, respectively. Notably, good stability in the recycling test and a high apparent quantum efficiency of about 69.9% at 420 nm were also obtained. The 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NRs exhibited enhanced photocatalytic contamination degradation efficiency of about 2 times higher than pure CdS-NRs. In this hybrid photocatalyst, 0D NiSx nanosheets came into intimate interfacial contact with the surface of 1D CdS-NRs and played a similar role as noble metals, which could effectively improve the separation, transportation efficiencies and lifetime of photogenerated charge, and thus enhance the photocatalytic performance of CdS-NRs with more efficient conversion of solar energy. This work shows not only a possibility for the utilization of noble metal-free NiSx as a co-catalyst in the photocatalysis, but also provides new insight into the design and fabrication of high-performance composite photocatalysts (such as NiSx/g-C3N4 and NiSx/Zn3In2S6).
Photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide splitting on metal-free powders assisted by phosphoric acid as a stabilizer	Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has received increasing attention as an energy carrier. To achieve a sustainable energy society, photocatalytic H2O2 splitting (H2O2 (l) → H2 (g) + O2 (g); ΔG° = + 131 kJ mol-1) is a desirable reaction for on-site H2 generation. However, this reaction has not been reported because conventional photocatalysis decomposes H2O2 by disproportionation (H2O2 (l) → H2O (l) + 1/2O2 (g); ΔG° = -117 kJ mol-1) and by promoting H2O2 reduction instead of H+ reduction. Here we report the successful example of H2O2 splitting. Visible light irradiation of a graphitic carbon nitride loaded with graphene quantum dots as co-catalysts (GQDs/g-C3N4) in a H2O2 solution containing phosphoric acid (H3PO4) produces H2. H3PO4 associates with H2O2 via hydrogen bonding, and this stabilization of H2O2 suppresses its reduction, thus promoting H+ reduction. The all-organic photosystem with H3PO4 as a stabilizer may provide a basis of photocatalytic H2O2 splitting.
Fabrication of sulfur-doped g-C3N4/Au/CdS Z-scheme photocatalyst to improve the photocatalytic performance under visible light	Au and CdS nanoparticles were firstly deposited on the surface of g-CNS by two-step self-assembly process to afford sandwich-structured Z-scheme g-CNS/Au/CdS photocatalyst. The photocatalytic reduction of water to hydrogen was highly improved in lactic acid scavenger solution using the as-prepared gCNS/Au/CdS than using g-CNS/CdS in the presence of visible light, and the photocatalytic degradation of RhB dye was also improved. According to the photoluminescence spectra and excited state electron radioactive decay lifetime, when Au was paired between g-CNS and CdS, based on the Z-scheme chargecarrier transfer mechanism, the redox ability of the photogenerated holes and electrons was enhanced, followed by the increased lifetime of the photoelectrons. Therefore, the photocatalytic ability of the g-CNS/Au/CdS composite was significantly improved. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Construction of C3N4/CdS nanojunctions on carbon fiber cloth as a filter-membrane-shaped photocatalyst for degrading flowing wastewater	Photocatalysis has become an exciting and energy-saving technology for wastewater purification, but its practical applications have been limited by the difficulty involved in obtaining efficient and easily recyclable macroscale photocatalysts. Herein, we report the construction of C3N4/CdS nanojunctions on carbon fiber (CF) cloth as a filter-membrane-shaped photocatalyst. CF/C3N4/CdS cloth exhibits enhanced photoabsorption and photocurrent. Under visible light irradiation, CF/C3N4/CdS cloth shows improved photocatalytic activity for different pollutants (99% methylene blue (MB), 98% acid orange 7 (AO7), 81% tetracycline (TC), 81% Cr(VI)), compared with CF/C3N4 cloth (99% MB, 74% AO7, 48% TC, 20% Cr(VI)) and CF/CdS cloth (35% MB, 10% AO7, 47% TC, 48% Cr(VI)). Furthermore, with CF/C3N4/CdS cloth as a filter-membrane-shaped photocatalyst, the removal rate for TC and Cr(VI) was found to increase up to 73% and 83% after a 6 grade reaction, respectively, higher than that obtained for CF/C3N4 cloth (52% TC, 22% Cr(VI)) or CF/CdS cloth (50% TC, 42% Cr(VI)). The improved photocatalytic activity of CF/C3N4/CdS cloth results from the construction of C3N4/CdS nanojunctions, which not only confers stronger photoabsorption but also results in the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. In particular, several possible pathways for TC degradation were proposed based on the intermediate products formed. Therefore, CF/C3N4/CdS cloth can act as an efficient and recyclable filter-membrane-shaped photocatalyst for dealing with flowing wastewater, and it also provides new perspectives for the development of flexible macroscale photocatalysts.

Facile and Versatile Functionalization of Two-Dimensional Carbon Nitrides by Design: Magnetism/Multiferroicity, Valleytronics, and Photovoltaics	Ab initio calculation evidence has shown that two-dimensional (2D) carbon nitrides may enable "facile functionalization" when a domain of carbon nitride is wetted by a solution of metal halides with mobile cations/anions. During the wetting process, each cavity can be functionalized by a unit of metal halide. Compared with prevailing functionalization or doping strategies through either high-temperature diffusion of source ions or ion implantation by using accelerators, such a room-temperature "wet-lab" functionalization approach is more facile and efficient. The wet-lab functionalization not only can facilitate isolation of the 2D monolayer, but also, with applying different metal halides, enable various new and desirable properties for broad applications, e.g., 2D magnetism and 2D ferroelectricity with high piezoelectric coefficient. The latter can be implemented in spin-independent valleytronics for non-volatile electrical manipulations. Notably, tunable bandgaps, ranging from 1.0 to 2.5 eV, can be realized by controlling the metal-halide functionalization density, while the separation of electrons/holes can be facilitated by the ferroelectric polarizations and heterostructure band alignments. Moreover, multifunctional domains like P/N doped or magnetic/ferroelectric domains can be selectively constructed through such solution-processed functionalization with different halides, followed by seamless integration into a single sheet of carbon nitride, akin to the P/N channels in silicon wafers.
Synthesis and characterization of CNx/TiN multilayers on Si(100) substrates	CNx/TiN multilayer coatings were deposited onto Si(100) substrates by using the reactive closed-field unbalanced magnetron sputtering method. Different bilayer thicknesses (B-T) were attained by varying the substrate rotation speed during the deposition process. The focus of this work was a collective investigation of the bonding states and structure of the multilayer by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD), and low-angle X-ray scattering (LXRD). The characteristic of the layer was also confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Chemical states such as TiN, TiO2, and TiC exist in the TiN layer. The CNx layer consisted of C, N and Ti in which N is bonded with C in the forms of C-N and C=N. The RMS surface roughness of the multilayers significantly varied with the substrate rotation speed. The RMS surface roughness was between 0.7 and 1.4 nm. The hardness of CNx/TiN multilayer was highly dependent on their bilayer thickness. This multi-layer structure demonstrated an enhanced microhardness with decreasing bilayer thickness. It is found that for smaller bilayer thicknesses, the microhardness reproducibly achieved is as high as similar to 50 GPa. In addition, stress measurement on the CNx/TiN multilayer is also conducted. The internal (compressive) stress is associated with the hardness of the multilayer. For the maximum hardness the stress is found to be similar to 7.7 GPa. Moreover, pin-on disc test under dry condition showed low friction coefficient (0.11). (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Magnetite/graphite carbon nitride composite for peroxymonosulfate non-radical activation	Magnetite-based catalysts are cost-effective and recyclable in water treatment processes. In this work, we constructed Fe3O4/g-C3N4 (FeOCN) catalyst by compounding g-C3N4 and Fe3O4. Based on characterization and experiments, the local positive and negative charges create active sites for catalyzing peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and bisphenol A (BPA) was confirmed. Through free radical quenching experiment, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, oxidant consumption and XPS, the mechanism of FeOCN-catalyzed PMS degradation of BPA was discussed. The electron transfer of surface-bound reactive complexes and O-1(2) were proved to play a role in the system. FeOCN not only achieves a pseudo first-order rate constant 35.7 times higher than Fe3O4, but also imparts pH stability (3-11) and applicability in actual water substrates (tap water, lake water, groundwater). This work provides a new insight into the engineering design of magnetite in the water treatment process to effectively treat organically polluted water.
Synthesis, characterization, surface properties and energy device characterstics of 2D borocarbonitrides, (BN)(x)C1-x, covalently cross-linked with sheets of other 2D materials	Covalent cross-linking of 2D structures such as graphene, MoS2 and C3N4 using coupling reactions affords the generation of novel materials with new or improved properties. These covalently cross-linked structures provide the counter point to the van der Waals heterostructures, with an entirely different set of features and potential applications. In this article, we describe the materials obtained by bonding borocarbonitride (BCN) layers with BCN layers as well as with other layered structures such as MoS2 and C3N4. While cross-linking BCN layers with other 2D sheets, we have exploited the existence of different surface functional groups on the graphene (COOH) and BN(NH2) domains of the borocarbonitrides as quantitatively determined by FLOSS. Hence, we have thus obtained two different BCN-BCN assemblies differing in the location of the cross-linking and these are designated as GG/BCN-BCN and GBN/BCN-BCN, depending on which domains of the BCN are involved in cross-linking. In this study, we have determined the surface areas and CO2 and H-2 adsorption properties of the cross-linked structures of two borocarbonitride compositions, (BN)(0.75)C-0.25 and (BN)(0.3)C-0.7. We have also studied their supercapacitor characteristics and photochemical catalytic activity for hydrogen generation. The study reveals that the covalently crosslinked BCN-BCN and BCN-MoS2 assemblies exhibit increased surface areas and superior supercapacitor performance. The BCN composite with MoS2 also shows high photochemical HER activity besides electrochemical HER activity comparable to Pt. This observation is significant since MoS2 in the nanocomposite is in the 2H form. The present study demonstrates the novelty of this new class of materials generated by cross-linking of 2D sheets of inorganic graphene analogues and their potential applications.
Synthesis of SnO2/B-P codoped g-C3N4 nanocomposites as efficient cocatalyst-free visible-light photocatalysts for CO2 conversion and pollutant degradation	Coping with the gradually increasing worldwide environmental issues, it is highly desired to develop efficient, cheap and visible-light responsive nano-photocatalysts for CO2 conversion and pollutant degradation. Herein, we have successfully synthesized SnO2-coupled boron and phosphorus co-doped g-C3N4 (SO/B-P-CN) nanocomposites as efficient cocatalyst-free visible-light photocatalysts of low cost for both CO2 conversion and pollutant degradation. It is shown that the amount-optimized SO/B-P-CN nanocomposite exhibits enhanced visible-light activities for CO2 conversion to CH4 from CO2-containing water by similar to 9 times, and for phenol and acetaldehyde degradation by similar to 7 times, as compared to the bare CN nanosheets. Moreover, it is confirmed that a large amount of produced hydroxyl radicals on SO/B-P-CN is well responsible for the greatly-enhanced photocatalytic activities. Interestingly, the evaluated quantum efficiency (2.02%) of optimized SO/B-P-CN nanocomposite for photocatalytic CO2 conversion at lambda=420 nm is much higher than other reported result. Mainly based on the surface photovoltage responses and the photocurrent action spectra, it is suggested that the enhanced activity of SO/B-P-CN nanocomposite depends on the extended visible-light absorption from 460 to 550 nm after B-P co-doping, and the promoted charge separation via the dopant-induced surface states and the coupled SO nanoparticles. This work implies that the modified CN nanosheets as cheap nanocomposites display promising applications in the photocatalytic field of CO2 conversion to useful fuels and pollutant degradation for environmental remediation.

Surface imprinting of a g-C3N4 photocatalyst for enhanced photocatalytic activity and selectivity towards photodegradation of 2-mercaptobenzothiazole	In the present work, based on Fe3O4/g-C3N4 as the support, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) as the template molecule, and pyrrole as the functional monomer, we synthesized magnetic conductive imprinted photocatalysts (MCIPs) that were significantly efficient and stable through a suspension polymerization method. Moreover, the MCIPs not only exhibited a higher photodegradation capacity for MBT under visible light irradiation, but also possessed good selectivity. The specific surface areas of the resultant MCIPs were approximately four times that of pure g-C3N4. Furthermore, the results indicated that h(+) was the major reactive species in the photocatalytic reaction system. The photodegradation mechanism was also discussed by analyzing the mass spectrum (MS), and the results demonstrated that MBT was degraded to H2O, CO2 and other small molecules, step by step. In addition, after five cycles, the MCIPs still showed high photocatalytic efficiency, indicating that the as-prepared MCIPs had excellent photochemical stability and good prospects for application in water treatment.
Ion coordination significantly enhances the photocatalytic activity of graphitic-phase carbon nitride	Here we report a facile surface modification route, metal ion coordination, to improve the photoactivity of carbon nitride. The metal ions coordinating into the plane of g-C3N4 significantly contribute to a drastic increase of the photocatalytic activity in solar hydrogen production as well as in the photodegradation of organic pollutants.
Fully automated graphitic carbon nitride-based disposable pipette extraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis of six polychlorinated biphenyls in environmental waters	A fully automated online emulsification-enhanced disposable pipette extraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (EE-DPX-GC-MS) method has been developed for the extraction of six polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from environmental waters. An in-house prepared material, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), was used as sorbent in a home-packed DPX device. The six PCBs studied include PCB 10, 28, 52, 153, 138 and 180. g-C3N4 was characterized successfully by X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy. As a C-N analogue of graphite, the two-dimensional structure of g-C3N4 allows rapid analyte adsorption and desorption to take place. With a significant number of nitrogen functionalities in g-C3N4, the material dispersed well in aqueous sample, increasing the active surface area of contact between the sorbent and the sample. When coupled with a pre-emulsification step, PCBs in each portion of sample could be efficiently extracted by g-C3N4 within 20 s of gentle turbulence. Under the most favorable conditions, the automated online EE-DPX-GC-MS method achieved wide dynamic working ranges with good linearity (r2 ≥ 0.998) for all analytes. Limits of detection ranging between 4.35 and 7.82 ng L-1 were attained, with enrichment factors of between 34 and 57 and relative standard deviations (RSDs) for intra- and inter-day precision of ≤ 8.95% and ≤ 12.6%, respectively. Absolute recoveries were between 69.3% and 109%. The fully automated online EE-DPX-GC-MS approach was applied to industrial wastewaters and reservoir waters where good relative recoveries of PCBs of between 89.3% and 105% were obtained, with RSDs ≤ 11.6%.
A green and facile method to prepare graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets with outstanding photocatalytic H2O2 production ability via NaClO hydrothermal treatment	Transportation and transformation of photogenerated carriers during the photocatalytic process of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) are restricted by the low surface area and insufficient charge separation efficiency. Exfoliation of g-C3N4 into few layered nanosheets is an ideal method to resolve these problems. This work provides a green and facile method to prepare g-C3N4 nanosheets with outstanding photocatalytic H2O2 production ability via NaClO hydrothermal treatment. This simple process could readily be extended to a kilogram scale. XRD, UV-vis, N-2 adsorption, SEM, TEM, XPS, O-2-TPD, EIS and PL were used to characterize the catalysts. Taking advantages of both the oxidation effect of ClO (-) and the intercalation effect of Na+, the obtained g-C3N4 nanosheets display a specific surface area as high as 145.6 m(2) g(-1). The carbon vacancies formed by NaClO treatment could promote the O-2 adsorption capacity of the catalyst and then activate the adsorbed O-2 molecule. The charge separation efficiency and redox ability of g-C3N4 nanosheets are also promoted compared with bulk g-C3N4, leading to the obviously improved H2O2 production ability. In addition, the obtained g-C3N4 nanosheets show higher photocatalytic performance than that prepared by chemical oxidation exfoliation, thermal exfoliation and intercalation exfoliation methods. This confirms that NaClO hydrothermal treatment is a more green, facile and effective method to prepare g-C3N4 nanosheet photocatalysts with outstanding performance.
Fabrication of Novel Ternary Three-Dimensional RuO2/Graphitic-C3N4@reduced Graphene Oxide Aerogel Composites for Supercapacitors	In this paper, one modified electrostatic self assembly strategy was proposed to achieve new ternary threedimensional (3D) graphene-based aerogel composite for smart supercapacitor (SC) candidates, where graphitic-C3N4 (g-C3N4) was selected as a component of increasing the electrochemical active center. Herein, the precursor RuO2/gC3N4@graphene oxide was prepared by protonized g-C3N4, positively charged RuO2 colloid nanoparticles (NPs), and negatively charged graphene oxide (GO), which was subsequently transformed to the designed 3D RuO2/gC3N4@reduced graphene oxide (rGO) aerogel composite (RCGA) via simple hydrothermal and lyophilization processes. In the electrochemical study, RCGA exhibited superior capacitive performance with a high specific capacitance of 704.3 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1) and excellent performance. Superior performance also was obtained in the asymmetric device. These results highlight the potential applications of this facile strategy in fabricating N-doped 3D rGO aerogel composite for high-performance SC.
Collagen heterogeneity and quantification in developing bovine nuchal ligament	The collagenous components were investigated in peptic digests of developing bovine nuchal ligament. Types I and III collagen were the major species isolated, but the presence of types IV, V and VI was also shown. Changes in the pepsin-susceptibility of nuchal ligament during foetal development were observed. CNBr-cleavage peptide analysis indicated that type I collagen became cross-linked rapidly, as evidenced by the lack of alpha 1(I)CB6. At present it is not clear if this decrease in pepsin-susceptibility is due to cross-linking of collagen, to increased deposition of elastin, or to both. Quantification of collagen types I and III was shown to depend on the method used. When pepsin-solubilized material was examined an apparent increase in type III collagen with respect to foetal age was observed, whereas when CNBr digests of intact ligament were examined a relatively constant amount of type III collagen (approx. 24%) was found. The constant amount of type III collagen observed during foetal development changed at birth and increased in mature nuchal ligament to represent approx. 45% of the total collagen.
Adsorption and photocatalytic splitting of water on graphitic carbon nitride: a combined first principles and semiempirical study	Graphitic carbon nitride, g-C3N4, is a promising organic photo-catalyst for a variety of redox reactions. In order to improve its efficiency in a systematic manner, however, a fundamental understanding of the microscopic interaction between catalyst, reactants and products is crucial. Here we present a systematic study of water adsorption on g-C3N4 by means of density functional theory and the density functional based tight-binding method as a prerequisite for understanding photocatalytic water splitting. We then analyze this prototypical redox reaction on the basis of a thermodynamic model providing an estimate of the overpotential for both water oxidation and H(+) reduction. While the latter is found to occur readily upon irradiation with visible light, we derive a prohibitive overpotential of 1.56 eV for the water oxidation half reaction, comparing well with the experimental finding that in contrast to H2 production O2 evolution is only possible in the presence of oxidation cocatalysts.
A bio-chemical application of N-GQDs and g-C3N4 QDs sensitized TiO 2 nanopillars for the quantitative detection of pcDNA3-HBV	Herein, TiO2 nanopillars (NPs)/N-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs)/g-C3N4 QDs heterojunction efficiently suppressed the photogenerated charges recombination and improved photo-to-current conversion efficiency. The introduced N-GQDs and g-C3N4 QDs could result in more effective separation of the photogenerated charges, and thus produce a further increase of the photocurrent. TiO2 NPs/N-GQDs/g-C3N4 QDs were firstly applied as the photoactive materials for the fabrication of the biosensors, and the primers of pcDNA3-HBV were then adsorbed on the TiO2 NPs/N-GQDs/g-C3N4 QDs modified electrode under the activation of EDC/NHS. With increase of the pcDNA3-HBV concentration, the photocurrent reduced once the double helix between the primers and pcDNA3-HBV formed. The developed photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensor showed a sensitive response to pcDNA3-HBV in a linear range of 0.01 fmol/L to 20nmol/L with a detection limit of 0.005 fmol/L under the optimal conditions. The biosensor exhibited high sensitivity, good selectivity, good stability and reproducibility.
H2O2 Assisted Photoelectrocatalytic Oxidation of Ag-Cyanide Complexes at Metal-free g-C3N4 Photoanode with Simultaneous Ag Recovery	A g-C3N4 thin film was synthesized by a liquid-based reaction onto ITO substrate via the calcination treatment. The resultant electrode was used as photoanode for photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) oxidation of Ag cyanide complexes with simultaneous Ag recovery, which was enhanced with the addition of H2O2. Surface variation of the gC3N4 photoanode and titanium cathode was analyzed using SEM, XRD, and XPS techniques. It was observed that, with the cyanide oxidation, Ag oxides and metal Ag were deposited onto the g-C3N4 photoanode and titanium cathode, respectively. The photoelectrochemical response of the g-C3N4 photoanode was obviously increased after the Ago deposition. ESR and trapping experiments confirmed the existence and roles of O-center dot(2)- and (OH)-O-center dot in the PEC oxidation process. The photogenerated electrons from gC3N4 could be captured by O-center dot(2)- and H2O2, generating (OH)-O-center dot radicals for oxidizing the Ag cyanide complexes. Meanwhile, the deposition of AgO species onto the g-C3N4 surface increased its and the migration rate of the photogenerated electrons. Deposited AgO can also enhance the production leading to an increased PEC activity toward the cyanide destruction. electrical conductivity of active radicals,
Layered Boron-Nitrogen-Carbon-Oxygen Materials with Tunable Composition as Lithium-Ion Battery Anodes	The insertion of heteroatoms with different electronegativity into carbon materials can tune their chemical, electronic, and optical properties. However, in traditional solid-state synthesis, it is challenging to control the reactivity of monomers, and therefore, the amount and position of heteroatoms in the final materials. Herein, a simple, scalable, and general molten-state route to synthesize boron-nitrogen-carbon-oxygen (BNCO) materials with tunable boron-nitrogen-carbon composition, as well as electronic and optical properties, is reported. The new synthetic approach consists of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and ammonia-borane as reactants that form a clear liquid-state stage spanning a wide temperature range, before the solid-state reaction. The molten-state stage enhances the control over the synthetic intermediates and final materials, owing to improved monomer miscibility and reactivity. The BNCO composition and optical properties are tuned by the PAH selection and final reaction temperature. The advantages of this method are demonstrated herein through the tunable optical properties, excellent stability to oxidization, facile deposition on substrates, and good activity as an anode material in lithium-ion batteries.
A novel preparation of GaN-ZnO/g-C3N4 photocatalyst for methylene blue degradation	GaN-ZnO solid solution (labeled as GN-ZO) was prepared by a novel method using melamine as a nitrogen source and then GaN-ZnO/g-C3N4 composite (denoted as GN-ZO/CN) was synthesized by the polymerization of melamine in the presence of GN-ZO. The photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) on GN-ZO/CN was assessed, which shows that the degradation efficiency of MB over GN-ZO/CN reaches up to 98.1% after 5 h. This is due to a reduced recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes in the composite. The photocatalytic activity of GN-ZO/CN is stable after 4 cycles. The mechanism for photocatalytic degradation of MB on GN-ZO/CN is proposed.
Fabrication of Z-scheme photocatalysts g-C3N4/Ag 3 PO 4/chitosan for the photocatalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin	In the present study, we have fabricated a novel chitosan based nanocomposite (g-C3N4/Ag3PO4/CS) containing g-C3N4 and Ag3PO4 nanoparticles. The fabricated nanocomposite was characterized successfully and used as a catalyst for photocatalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin (CIP) under visible light. The TEM results revealed that the g-C3N4 and Ag3PO4 nanoparticles are well dispersed into the polymer matrix. The surface area of the nanocomposite was determine using N2adsorption and desorption isotherm and calculated using BET equation and found to be 112.47 m2/g. The photocatalytic degradation of CIP was studied at different initial concentrations. The intermediate of and the degradation mechanism was determining using LCMS and DFT techniques. The results revealed that as-fabricated nanocomposite, g-C3N4/Ag3PO4/CS shows, 90.34% degradation of CIP within 60 min at room temperature in neutral medium. The CIP degradation kinetics displays the first-order kinetics with 0.01771 min-1. The reusability of the photocatalyst was observed after six cycles and g-C3N4/Ag3PO4/CS catalyst remains 79.43% degradation of CIP in similar condition.
PANI/g-C3N4 Composites Synthesized by Interfacial Polymerization and Their Thermal Stability and Photocatalytic Activity	Polyaniline (PANI) nanorods grown on layered graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) sheets are synthesized by interfacial polymerization. The structure, morphology, and properties of the photocatalysts are characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and UV-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopies, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and electrochemical analysis. Photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue is investigated to determine the photoactivity of the catalyst. The results suggest that g-C3N4 possesses good dispersion with an intercalated nanostructure and interfacial adhesion with PANI. In addition; the PANI/g-C3N4 composites retain the advantage of high thermal stability resident with g-C3N4. This is ascribed to a physical barrier effect on the emanation of degradation products and inhibited polymer motion. The resulting composites also show more intensive photocatalytic activity than does g-C3N4.
Supramolecular self-assembly production of porous carbon nitride nanosheets with excellent photocatalytic activity by a melamine derivative as doping molecule	Since doping has a good effect on improving the photocatalytic performance of carbon nitride (CN), the doping scheme has been extensively studied. In this work, a melamine derivative (2, 4-diamino-6-phenoxy-[1, 3, 5]triazine, MA-phO) was synthesized and used as a new doping molecule to prepare the modified-CN materials by a facile supramolecular self-assembly method with melamine (MA) and cyanuric acid (CA). The "growth stoppers" effect caused by the doping molecule MA-phO in the supramolecular complex made the modified-CN materials more favorable for forming nanostructure and increasing the specific surface areas. The decomposition of phenyl group allowed C atoms to be incorporated into the CN skeleton which facilitated the separation of photogenerated h(+)/e(-) pairs. What's more, the addition of MA-phO could regulate the energy band structure of modified-CN materials. It has been found that the amount of doping molecule affected the photocatalytic performance of photocatalyst. Especially when the doping amount reached 0.5%, the prepared sample had the best photocatalytic activity for the organic pollutants. Significantly, design and synthesis of new melamine derivatives as doping molecules and pretreatment by using supramolecular self-assembly strategy may provide a facile approach for the preparation of tunable morphology, energy band structure and heteroatom-doped g-C3N4.
Mesocrystalline Ti3+-TiO2 hybridized g-C3N4 for efficient visible-light photocatalysis	TiO2 mesocrystals are often considered to be a fascinating and efficient photocatalyst because of its long lifetime carriers and effective conduction pathways. However, TiO2 mesocrystals showed no visible light response and visible light photocatalytic activity. To overcome these shortages, mesocrystalline Ti3+-TiO2 (meso-TiO2) and its composites are highly desired to have strong capacity for harvesting visible light and photocatalytic hydrogen production. In this work, Ti3+ doped TiO2 mesocrystals were successfully prepared through oriented attachment mechanisms, and direct Z-scheme Ti3+ self-doped TiO2 mesocrystals/g-C3N4 composites were also prepared by facile solvethermal method. The asprepared Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals showed visible light absorption and photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production. Interestingly, the as-prepared Ti3+ doped meso-TiO2/g-C3N4 composites displayed highly improved visible light absorption and visible light photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production, and the highest photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production was about 3748.46 mmol g(-1) h(-1) with an apparent quantum efficiency of 1.42% at 400 nm (sacrificial agent, triethanolamine) and 983.56 mmol g(-1) h(-1) (sacrificial agent, methanol), much higher than that of g-C3N4 and Ti3+ doped TiO2 mesocrystals, mainly due to the high charge separation efficiency, long lifetime carriers and effective transport pathways. Finally, possible direct Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism of Ti3+ doped mesoTiO(2)/g-C3N4 composites were proposed in detail. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Detection of cyanide by etching-induced electrochemiluminescence recovery	Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) emission of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) loaded graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (Au-CNN nanohybrids) can be modulated by the Au content. On the basis, a signal-on ECL sensor for detecting cyanide, a widespread toxic chemical, has been developed in this work. The sensor utilizes cyanide-mediated etching of Au NPs to recover the ECL emission of Au-CNN nanohybrids initially inhibited by Fo rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from CNNs to Au NPs. The ECL sensor has a sensitive response to cyanide in the range of 50 nM to 1mM with a detection limit of 50 nM, and shows high specificity due to the high affinity of Au-cyanide complex. The proposed FRET modulated ECL sensor may prove valuable in future environmental monitoring. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Plasmonic stimulated photocatalytic/electrochemical hydrogen evolution from water by (001) faceted and bimetallic loaded titania nanosheets under sunlight irradiation	This study demonstrates the synthesis of TiO2 nanosheets (TNST) exhibiting high percentage (54%) of exposed (001) facets and decorated with co-deposited gold and platinum nanoparticles (NPs). The as synthesized as well as modified sheets are then investigated for the photo-reduction of water under sunlight irradiation using different alcohols as hole-scavengers. Structural and morphological studies manifest the formation of well-defined sheet structure of TiO2 with average dimensions of 55 nm x 46 nm. The measured d spacing of 0.34 nm and 0.23 nm corresponds to (101) and (001) facets of anatase TiO2. The presence of Au and Pt was confirmed by electron diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. TiO2 nanosheets (TNST's) with 0.4 and 0.75 wt % of Au and Pt (Au-0.4/Pt-0(.75)-TNSTs), respectively were found to exhibit higher efficiency. Furthermore, photo-electrochemical (PEC) water splitting studies revealed the increase in photocurrent from 2 mA at 0.5 V to 4.5 mA at 0.65 V for Au-0.4/Pt-0(.75)-TNST photoelectrodes, which otherwise was 0.15 mA for the bare TNST photoelectrodes at the same potential. The observed PEC performance was well supported by impedance analysis, wherein Au-0.4/Pt-0(.75)-TNSTs (338 Omega) are found to exhibit lower resistance in comparison to bare TNST (737 Omega), which could be due to brilliant photo conductance and interfacial charge transfer properties of Au-0.4 Pt-0(.75)-TNSTs. Photocatalytically the Au-0.4/Pt-0.75-TNST produced similar to 143 mu mol h(1) of H-2 gas under direct sunlight irradiation, which is found equivalent to 16.1% apparent quantum efficiency.

Carbon nitride-catalyzed oxidative cleavage of carbon-carbon bond of alpha-hydroxy ketones with visible light and thermal radiation	Mesoporous carbon nitride (mpg-C3N4) as a photocatalyst showed higher photocatalytic activities in organic synthesis. Herein we reported a mpg-C3N4-catalyzed oxidation of alpha-hydroxy ketones to synthesize benzoic acids with visible light. This reaction represented a green and facile route to synthesize benzoic acids for which catalytic approaches were scarce. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Method for the synthesis of water-soluble oxide of graphite-like carbon nitride	The new route to synthesize the oxygen containing carbon nitride is developed. In contrast to known methods, our approach does not require the preliminary preparation of g-C3N4: pyrolysis of melamine is carried out at the presence of oxygen. First alongside with the oxygen-doped (similar to 8.1%) carbon nitride (O-g-C3N4) an oxide of carbon nitride (g-C3N4)O was obtained as a new substance that has a structure similar to the graphite oxide. Nanosized powder of (g-C3N4)O is easily dissolved and exfoliated in water with the formation of a flake-like solution, which can contain nanosheets from several heptazine layers.

Facile synthesis of high quality Z-scheme W18O49 nanowire-g-C3N4 photocatalyst for the enhanced visible light-driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution	Novel Z-scheme W18O49 nanowire-g-C3N4 nanosheet composite photocatalysts were prepared by a facile solvothermal process. The morphology of W18O49 nanocrystals was significantly changed from urchin sphere to nanowire bundles with the increase of C3N4 quantity. The W18O49-g-C3N4 composites enhance the ability of harvesting visible light, and promote the charge transfer across the composite interface. All the as-prepared composites show higher photocatalytic activity of hydrogen production than that of pure W18O49 and g-C3N4. And the WCN50 composite with 50 mg of g-C3N4 displays the optimal photocatalytic activity with the highest hydrogen production rate of 1.700 mmol g(-1) h(-1) under visible light-irradiation. The improved photocatalytic activity is due to the stronger light harvesting ability, the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism to promote the interface charge transfer, and the prolonged lifetime of photogenerated electrons. Our work will provide a valuable reference for the design of highly efficient Zscheme photocatalysts for efficiently converting solar energy into chemical fuels. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Characterization of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase. Primary structure of the Pseudomonas enzyme	The primary structure of Pseudomonas 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase was determined. Sequence degradation of the intact protein and of peptides from three different digests of the carboxymethylated protein established a 357-residue polypeptide chain with a free alpha-amino group. Hydroxylamine cleavage at a single Asn-Gly sequence was useful. Comparisons with known structures in data banks revealed no close relationship with other characterized proteins. The human enzyme has a related composition, suggesting that also the eukaryotic form belongs to this protein type, but with a blocked N-terminus like in many other eukaryotic intracellular proteins. Secondary structure predictions suggest an alpha/beta mixed structure, fairly typical of globular proteins, without long segments of hydrophobicity or charge, although a region in the middle of the C-terminal third of the subunit appears to have the most extreme properties. A ferric centre, correlating with enzyme activity and absorbance at 595 nm, has previously been assigned to tyrosinate coordination. The Tyr and His distributions, and the position of a single Cys residue, all suggest a few likely sites, outside the C-terminal segment, for this centre.
Highly antifouling and chlorine resistance polyamide reverse osmosis membranes with g-C3N4 nanosheets as nanofiller	Improvement of antifouling and chlorine resistance properties of polyamide (PA) reverse osmosis (RO) membranes have been major challenges for desalination of seawater. In this work, graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (g-C3N4 NS) were incorporated into PA membranes (PA/CN) through an in-situ interfacial polymerization process. With the optimized g-C3N4 NS loading within the PA-RO membranes (PA/CN100), the water permeability was improved by about 30% with a high salt rejection ratio of 99.23%. More importantly, due to the attractive features of g-C3N4 NS, including N-H bonds to provide more chlorine attack sites, rich oxygen-containing functional groups to capture and react with chlorine radicals, negatively charged membrane surface to repel and isolate active chlorine and pollutants, the chlorine resistance and antifouling performance of PA RO membranes were greatly enhanced. After being immersed in an active chlorine solution of 1000 ppm for 24 h, the PA/CN100 membranes show a higher chlorine resistance compared to that of pure PA RO membranes, with salt rejection decreased by 1.08% and 2.95%, respectively. Moreover, after 200 ppm bovine serum albumin (BSA) treatment, the total fouling rate was 31.2% for PA membrane and 18.3% for PA/CN100 membrane. This work provides a promising approach to improve the comprehensive performance for desalination and the trend of industrialization.
Graphene Layers-Wrapped Fe/Fe5C2 Nanoparticles Supported on N-doped Graphene Nanosheets for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction	Synthesis of highly efficient nonprecious metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) superior to platinum (Pt) is still a big challenge. Herein, a new highly active ORR electrocatalyst is reported based on graphene layers-wrapped Fe/Fe5C2 nanoparticles supported on N-doped graphene nanosheets (GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG) through simply annealing a mixture of bulk graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and ferrocene. An interesting exfoliation-denitrogen mechanism underlying the conversion of bulk g-C3N4 into N-doped graphene nanosheets is revealed. Owing to the high graphitic degree, optimum N-doping level and sufficient active sites from the graphene layers-wrapped Fe/Fe5C2 nanoparticles, the as-prepared GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG electrocatalyst obtained at 800 degrees C exhibits outstanding ORR activity with a 20 mV more positive half-wave potential than the commercial Pt/C catalyst in 0.1 m KOH solution and a comparable onset potential of 0.98 V. This makes GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG an outstanding electrocatalyst for ORR in alkaline solution.
Deliberate construction of direct Z-scheme photocatalysts through photodeposition	Constructing Z-scheme type photocatalysts is preferred to achieve efficient photocatalyst owing to the high oxidative and reductive capabilities of composite catalysts. The direct Z-scheme (DZS) is composed of two semiconductors contacting each other, which eliminates the disadvantages of using an electron mediator in liquid and solid-state Z-schemes. However, deliberately constructing a DZS remains challenging. In this report, two semiconductors were denoted as SC-I and SC-II according to the natural photosynthesis process. Two routes for constructing DZS catalysts through photodeposition were demonstrated, which effectively regulated the photogenerated charge transfer direction. Starting from SC-I, SC-II was selectively deposited at the hole-rich site of SC-I by photooxidation. Starting from SC-II, SC-I was selectively grown at the electron-rich site of SC-II through photoreduction. This selective deposition promoted directional charge recombination to form DZS catalysts. Two examples, Fe2O3/g-C3N4 and CdS/TiO2, were synthesized by photooxidation and photoreduction, respectively. Charge-transfer tracking and reactive oxygen species were used to check the charge transfer direction and radical type. The results showed that both systems indeed formed DZS catalysts. Based on the above results, photodeposition can be used to deliberately construct DZS catalysts.
Cysteine enhances activity and stability of immobilized papain	Immobilization of papain on Sepharose 6B in the presence of different concentrations of cysteine affected the enzyme activity depending on cysteine concentration. The maximum specific activity was observed when papain was immobilized with 200 mM cysteine. The immobilization process brought significant enhancement of stability to temperature and extreme pH values with respect to free papain. After immobilization, the optimum temperature of papain activity increased by 20 degrees C (from 60 to 80 degrees C) and its optimum pH activity shifted from 6.5 to 8.0. Catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) and specific activity of the immobilized enzyme do not significantly change after immobilization. The temperature profile of this form of immobilized papain showed a broad range of activity compared with both free and immobilized form of papain in the absence of cysteine. This significant behavior in terms of activation energy is also discussed.
Interplay of electronic structure and bulk properties in 2D and 3D ternary carbonitrides from first principles	The changes in electronic structure and hardness as inferred from the bulk modulus are investigated for model structures of ternary compounds XC3N3 (X = B, Al, P, As, Ga) within the framework of density functional theory (DFT). The optimisations of the proposed two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) structures and the calculations of the bulk moduli are performed by a pseudo potential method. The electronic structures are calculated with the augmented sphere wave method (ASW). The obtained hardness for 2D BC3N3 system (B-0 similar to 220 GPa) points to a magnitude close to that of graphitic C3N4. For heavier X atoms it decreases rapidly. This is equally observed for the 3D systems examined in the beta-C3N4 structure for which B-0 (beta-BC3N3) amounts to similar to330 GPa. Within the magnitude of the well known hard material cubic BN, the BC3N3 phases can be predicted as candidates for ultra hard materials. The electronic effect induced by the chemical nature of the X substitutional was examined according to its position in the periodic table i.e. X-III or X-V. Both, band structures and the electron localisation function (ELF) were used for this analysis. The ELF plots show a decreasing covalency with heavier X-atoms. Potential applications of the devised systems are proposed such as dopings with atoms (Li, rare gas) and molecules (N-2).
Single crystal film of carbon nitride-consists of hexagonal system gallium nitride, aluminium nitride, indium nitride, hexagonal system silicon carbide, or zinc oxide	
An oxygen-vacancy-rich Z-scheme g-C3N4/Pd/TiO2 heterostructure for enhanced visible light photocatalytic performance	An oxygen-vacancy-rich Z-scheme g-C3N4/Pd/TiO2 ternary nanocomposite was fabricated using nanotubular titanic acid as precursors via a simple photo-deposition of Pd nanoparticles and calcination process. The prepared nanocomposites were investigated by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, respectively. For g-C3N4/TiO2 binary nanocomposites, at the optimal content of g-C3N4 (2%), the apparent photocatalytic activity of 2% g-C3N4/TiO2 was 9 times higher than that of pure TiO2 under visible-light illumination. After deposition of Pd (1 wt%) at the contact interface between g-C3N4 and TiO2, the 2% g-C3N4/Pd/TiO2 ternary nanocomposites demonstrated the highest visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity for the degradation of gaseous propylene, which was 16- and 2-fold higher activities than pure TiO2 and 2% g-C3N4/TiO2, respectively. The mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the g-C3N4/Pd/TiO2 photo-catalyst is proposed to be based on the efficient separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs through Z-scheme system, in which uniform dispersity of Pd nanoparticles at contact interface between g-C3N4 and TiO2 and oxygen vacancies promote charge separation.

All-inorganic perovskite/graphitic carbon nitride composites for CO 2 photoreduction into C1 compounds under low concentrations of CO 2	CsPbBr3 is widely used in solar cells and LEDs for its excellent photoelectric properties that are also attractive for CO2 photoreduction, but it is less used in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 mainly owing to its limited charge separation efficiency. To alleviate this issue, herein, all-inorganic orthorhombic CsPbBr3 was combined with graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and the resultant composite (CsPbBr3@g-C3N4) showed enhanced activity in CO2 photoreduction. Under the irradiation of AM1.5 filter for 12 h, CO2 was converted into CH4 and CO with high selectivity to methane (91%) and the total amount of gaseous products up to ∼300 μmol g-1. This reactivity is 6-fold and 4-fold higher than that of pure g-C3N4 and CsPbBr3, respectively. CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 also shows excellent catalytic activity at low concentrations of CO2. Studies of energy band level and steady-state and transient photoluminescence spectroscopy indicated that the incorporation of CsPbBr3 and g-C3N4 increases charge separation, which may result in sharply enhanced catalytic efficiency. This study has provided opportunities for the combination of CsPbBr3 and other semiconductor catalysts for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.
Enhancing visible light photocatalytic activity of BiOBr/rod-like BiPO4 through a heterojunction by a two-step method	Visible light driven BiOBr/rod-like BiPO4 composites with different BiOBr to BiPO4 molar ratios were fabricated via a facile deposition-precipitation method. X-ray powder diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area were used to characterize the as-synthesized samples. Results showed that the BiOBr/rod-like BiPO4 composite with equal mole ratio exhibited the best photocatalytic performance for rhodamine B (RhB) degradation under visible light irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic performance could be mainly attributed to the effective separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes at the heterojunction interface of p-BiOBr and n-BiPO4.
The structure of the B subunit of calcineurin	The complete primary structure of the B subunit of calcineurin (protein phosphatase 2B) has been determined by automated sequence analysis. The protein consists of a single polypeptide chain of 168 residues, relative molecular mass 19200. The structure shows 35% identity with the sequence of calmodulin and 29% with troponin C. Homology is mainly confined to the regions of the four putative Ca2+-binding loops. The results demonstrate that the B subunit is a new member of this family of Ca2+-binding proteins. The N-terminal glycine residue is blocked with the C14-saturated fatty acid myristic acid and the first four residues are very similar to those of the catalytic subunit of cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase which also contains a myristoyl blocking group.
Optimized Doxorubicin Chemotherapy for Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma Exploits Nanocarrier Delivery to Transferrin Receptors	New treatments are needed to address persistent unmet clinical needs for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Overexpression of transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) is common across cancer and permits cell-surface targeting of specific therapies in preclinical and clinical studies of various solid tumors. Here, we developed novel nanocarrier delivery of chemotherapy via TFR1-mediated endocytosis, assessing this target for the first time in DLBCL. Analysis of published datasets showed novel association of increased TFR1 expression with high-risk DLBCL cases. Carbon-nitride dots (CND) are emerging nanoparticles with excellent in vivo stability and distribution and are adaptable to covalent conjugation with multiple substrates. In vitro, linking doxorubicin (Dox) and transferrin (TF) to CND (CND-Dox-TF, CDT) was 10-100 times more potent than Dox against DLBCL cell lines. Gain- and loss-of-function studies and fluorescent confocal microscopy confirmed dependence of these effects on TFR1-mediated endocytosis. In contrast with previous therapeutics directly linking Dox and TF, cytotoxicity of CDT resulted from nuclear entry by Dox, promoting double-stranded DNA breaks and apoptosis. CDT proved safe to administer in vivo, and when incorporated into standard frontline chemoimmunotherapy in place of Dox, it improved overall survival by controlling patient-derived xenograft tumors with greatly reduced host toxicities. Nanocarrier-mediated Dox delivery to cell-surface TFR1, therefore, warrants optimization as a potential new therapeutic option in DLBCL. SIGNIFICANCE: Targeted nanoparticle delivery of doxorubicin chemotherapy via the TRF1 receptor presents a new opportunity against high-risk DLBCL tumors using potency and precision.
Facile synthesis and enhanced visible-light photoactivity of a g-C3N4/mullite composite	A novel g-C3N4/mullite composite with enhanced visible light-driven photoactivity was prepared through a facile wetting chemical method. The microstructure, interfacial and optical properties of the obtained g-C3N4/mullite composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), surface area measurement (BET), and UV-visible diffused reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS), respectively. It is indicated that a tight interfacial combination was formed between g-C3N4 and mullite, which is beneficial for the transfer of electrons and the enhancement of quantum efficiency. Compared with pure g-C3N4 or a g-C3N4 + mullite physical mixture, the synthesized g-C3N4/mullite composites exhibit significantly enhanced photoactivity under visible light irradiation, almost 6.5 times that of the pure g-C3N4 and around 10.0 times that of a g-C3N4 + mullite physical mixture for the degradation of tetracycline. The enhanced photoactivity of the g-C3N4/mullite composite could be attributed not only to its stronger visible light adsorption and enhanced adsorption capacity for pollutants but also to the strong interfacial combination between g-C3N4 and mullite, effectively reducing the recombination probability of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.
Novel visible light induced Co3O4-g-C3N4 heterojunction photocatalysts for efficient degradation of methyl orange	Novel visible-light-induced Co3O4-g-C3N4 heterojunction photocatalysts were synthesized via a facile mixing-and-heating method. The as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS), electron spin resonance (ESR) and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). The heterojunction photocatalysts exhibit a significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity in degrading methyl orange (MO). The optimal Co3O4 content with the highest photocatalytic activity was determined to be 0.2 wt%. The synergetic effect between Co3O4 and g-C3N4 plays an important role in promoting photo-generated carrier separation. The ESR and PL results reveals that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of Co3O4-g-C3N4 was mainly due to the superior amount and longer lifetime of oxidative radicals (O-.(2)-), as well as the efficient separation of charge carriers. Possible mechanism is proposed for the high photocatalytic activity of heterojunction structures, to guide the design of photocatalysts. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Solar-light-driven rapid water disinfection by ultrathin magnesium titanate/carbon nitride hybrid photocatalyst: Band structure analysis and role of reactive oxygen species	Novel and cost-effective Z-scheme 2D/2D MgTi2O5/g-C3N4 hybrid was synthesized by in situ growth of MgTi2O5 on the g-C3N4 nanosheets. The photocatalytic activity of as-prepared hybrid was investigated using bacteria disinfection. The results indicated that the composite exhibited enhanced E. coli inactivation under visible light (VL) irradiation, with the complete inactivation of 7 log10 cfu/mL of cells reduction within 3 h, while the pristine g-C3N4 and MgTi2O5 almost showed no cell reduction under the same condition. The destruction of bacterial cell was investigated by fluorescence microscopic images and transmission electron microscopy analysis. The optimum photoactivity could be attributed to 1) the short charge transport distance and large interface contact area of the 2D/2D structure, 2) the efficient charge separation and spatially separated reductive and oxidative active sites originated from Z-scheme system. This work could shed lights on the design and fabrication of 2D/2D Z-scheme system for VL driven water disinfection.
Enhancing visible light photocatalytic activity of nitrogen-deficient g-C3N4 via thermal polymerization of acetic acid-treated melamine	Nitrogen-deficient graphitic carbon nitride (CN-HAc) was synthesized by thermal condensation of acetic acid-treated melamine as a precursor. The nitrogen vacancies play a remarkable role on controlling the electronic structure of g-C3N4, such as extending the optical absorption and enhancing the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers, resulting in the improvement of photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic activity of the catalysts was evaluated by splitting water and degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) under visible light irradiation (λ>420nm). The average H2 evolution rate on CN-HAc is 24μmolh-1, which is about 5 times of that on pristine g-C3N4. Meanwhile, CN-HAc exhibits superior photocatalytic mineralization of RhB. The possible formation mechanism of nitrogen-deficient in the framework of g-C3N4 is proposed.
The Effect of Phosphorous Doping on the Composition and Capacitance Properties of Mesoporous Graphitic Carbon Nitride	The effect of phosphorus doping on the composition and capacitance properties of mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (MGCN) is investigated systemically and reported in this article. Pristine and phosphorous doped MGCN are synthesized by using a bio-compatible template, carboxymethyl cellulose, and orthophosphoric acid as a dopant. Powder X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopic studies confirm the formation of stacked layers of MGCN. Vibrational and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies reveal that phosphorus is doped preferentially on the sites of carbon and, thereby induces defects. The defect and surface area are found to increase on increasing the dopant concentration. Owing to the presence of functionalities, such as P-O and C-P, P-doped MGCN delivers higher specific capacitance than pristine MGCN at all current rates. A symmetrical supercapacitor device fabricated using the electrodes of MGCN synthesized using 0.5 g of dopant delivers an energy density of 17.22 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 500 W kg(-1).

Biomimetic polymeric semiconductor based hybrid nanosystems for artificial photosynthesis towards solar fuels generation via CO2 reduction	In photosynthesis, an intricate polymeric system is constructed by connecting a light-harvesting antenna network, a molecular water oxidation center, and CO2 or proton-reduction machinery in a nanolayered architecture as a basic photosynthetic unit for solar-to-fuels conversion. Herein, we present a prototype basic artificial photosynthetic unit by connecting a typical CO2/proton reduction catalyst, a cocatalyst and an electron mediator as well as CO2 activator into a polymer based nano-architectured system for artificial photosynthesis with water and CO2. Here, g-C3N4 nanosheets, mimicking the nanolayered thylakoids stacks are demonstrated as promising photocatalytic elements with planar configuration and high surface area, which provide an excellent platform for the assembly of other analogous elements. Au NPs are served as a suitable cocatalyst. ZIF-9, as a typical cofactor to illustrate this concept here, is used as a CO2 concentrator and an electron mediator to promote the redox reaction. In artificial photosynthesis, driven by light energy, water and CO2 are served electron donor and carbon source respectively for the generation of H-2 and CO. The artificial unit described here as a simple model, provides an important biomimetic step down a path aligned with the low-cost artificial photosynthetic systems manufacturing.

Room temperature gas sensing under UV light irradiation for Ti3C2Tx MXene derived lamellar TiO2-C/g-C3N4 composites	Two-dimensional layered-structured Ti3C2Tx MXene was prepared with hydrochloric acid and LiF. TiO2-C/g-C3N4 (TC-CN) composites were prepared by in situ growth method using melamine and Ti3C2Tx as a precursor. The structural properties of the as-prepared samples were characterized using SEM, XRD, and FT-IR measurements. The SEM image of TC-CN shows that it possesses an MXene-like lamellar structure. The gas sensing performances of TC-CN toward different volatile organic compounds gases at room temperature under UV light irradiation were investigated. The gas sensing results revealed that TC-CN showed excellent response value for 91 to 10 ppm ethanol at room temperature under UV light irradiation. The excellent gas sensing performances can be attributed to the UV light irradiation, construction of energy level dislocation, and lamellar structure of the composites, which leads to the enhancement of photoelectrons, reduction of the recombination of photoelectrons and holes, and high transportation of electrons in the TC-CN heterojunction, consequently enhancing the combination of the electrons and oxygen. Further, the possible gas sensing mechanism of the material was proposed and discussed.
Structural and functional characterization of proteolytic fragments derived from the C-terminal regions of bovine fibrinogen	A number of new as well as previously described fragments derived from the D region of bovine fibrinogen by limited proteolysis have been characterized by sequence analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism. Determination of the extremities of the polypeptide chains forming individual fragments allowed the scheme of proteolysis and the borders between domains in the D region of fibrinogen to be established. It was also found that the most thermostable region of the D fragment (TSD) can be substantially reduced in size without loss of its compact structure. The alpha-helical content of the newly prepared 21-kDa TSD2 and 16-kDa TSD3 fragments were 82% and 75%, respectively, strongly supporting a coiled-coil structure for this region of the fibrinogen molecule. The DX and DZ fragments, prepared from a chymotryptic digest of the DLA fragment, were found to be similar to the DL and DY fragments, respectively, except for an internal cleavage at K393-T394 in their beta chains. This cleavage leads to destabilization of all thermolabile domains, indicating interaction between them. The DL and DY fragments, containing only one polymerization site in their beta chains, were able to inhibit fibrin polymerization at high concentration. However, these same fragments failed to bind to fibrin-Sepharose under conditions where their structural analogues, DX and DZ, were tightly bound, indicating that cleavage after K393 substantially increases the affinity of this site.
Photoelectrochemical aptasensor for sulfadimethoxine using g-C3N4 quantum dots modified with reduced graphene oxide	A novel photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor with graphitic-phase carbon nitride quantum dots (g-C3N4; QDs) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was fabricated. The g-C3N4 QDs possess enhanced emission quantum yield (with an emission peak at 450 nm), improved charge separation ability and effective optical absorption, while rGO has excellent electron transfer capability. Altogether, this results in improved PEC performance. The method is making use of an aptamer against sulfadimethoxine (SDM) that was immobilized on electrode through π stacking interaction. Changes of the photocurrent occur because SDM as a photogenerated hole acceptor can further accelerate the separation of photoexcited carriers. Under optimized conditions and at an applied potential of +0.2 V, the aptasensor has a linear response in the 0.5 nM to 80 nM SDM concentration range, with a 0.1 nM detection limit (at S/N = 3). The method was successfully applied to the analysis of SDM in tap, lake and waste water samples. Graphical abstract Graphitic-phase carbon nitride (g-C3N4) quantum dots (QDs) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were used to modify fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) electrodes for use in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor. SDM oxidized by the hole on valance band (VB) of g-C3N4 QDs promote the separation of electron in the conductive band (CB), which made the changes of photocurrent signal.
In-situ construction of all-solid-state Z-scheme g-C3N4/TiO2 nanotube arrays photocatalyst with enhanced visible-light-induced properties	All-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalytic system, especially driven by visible light, has attracted intensive interests for realizing sustainable development addressing the increasing environmental pollution and energy issues. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) as one of the most studied semiconductor photocatalysts has been widely applied in solving the above issues. And graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a steady and earth abundant non-metallic visible-light photocatalyst. Here we demonstrate a facile and rapid method to successfully synthesize all-solid-state Z-scheme g-C3N4/TiO2 nanotube arrays which demonstrates enhanced photocatalytic performance than photocatalyst prepared by traditional post-synthesis under visible light irradiation.

First-principles investigation of nonmetal doped single-layer BiOBr as a potential photocatalyst with a low recombination rate	Nonmetal doping is an effective approach to modify the electronic band structure and enhance the photocatalytic performance of bismuth oxyhalides. Using density functional theory, we systematically examine the fundamental properties of single-layer BiOBr doped with boron (B) and phosphorus (P) atoms. The stability of the doped models is investigated based on the formation energies, where the substitutional doping is found to be energetically more stable under O-rich conditions than under Bi-rich ones. The results showed that substitutional doping of P atoms reduced the bandgap of pristine BiOBr to a greater extent than that of boron substitution. The calculation of the effective masses reveals that B doping can render the electrons and holes of pristine BiOBr lighter and heavier, respectively, resulting in a slower recombination rate of photoexcited electron-hole pairs. Based on the results of HOMO-LUMO calculations, the introduction of B atoms tends to increase the number of photocatalytically active sites. The top of the valence band and the conduction band bottom of the B doped BiOBr monolayer match well with the water redox potentials in an acidic environment. The absorption spectra propose that B(P) doping causes a red-shift. Overall, the results predict that nonmetal-doped BiOBr monolayers have a reduced bandgap, a slow recombination rate, more catalytically active sites, enhanced optical absorption edges, and reduced work functions, which will contribute to superior photocatalytic performance.
Facile synthesis and catalytic performance of nanosheet - nanorods g-C3N4-Bi2WO6 heterojunction catalyst and effect of silver nanoparticles loading on bare Bi2WO6 and g-C3N4-Bi2WO6 for N-deethylation process	Bi2WO6 nano-rods and g-C3N4-Bi2WO6 heterojunction and their corresponding silver loaded nanocatalysts were synthesized and characterized using XRD, FE-SEM, HR-TEM, XPS, photoluminescence (PL), and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). FE-SEM micrographs indicates that g-C3N4 nano-sheets are agglomerated with WO3 particles and Bi2WO6 nanorods in g-C3N4-WO3 and g-C3N4-Bi2WO6 catalysts respectively whereas, HR-TEM images confirmed the presence of interface between g-C3N4 sheets and Bi2WO6 nano-rods, and dispersion of less than 10 nm Ag particles over the heterojunction. A significant reduction in PL signal due to reduced electron hole recombination and consequent enhancement of catalytic activity were observed with the Ag/g-C3N4-Bi2WO6 catalyst. On bare Bi2WO6 nano-rods, Ndeethylation was found to be the prominent degradation pathway and with 1% silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs), this is fully quenched and ring closure pathway accounts for the dye degradation. In addition, performance of our catalyst was benchmarked with commercially available visible light driven photo-catalysts. The appropriate band positions for reduction and oxidation reactions, with the reduced charge recombination make this heterojunction suitable for applications like water splitting and other environmental applications.

The alpha-Fe2O3/g-C3N4 heterostructural nanocomposites with enhanced ethanol gas sensing performance	The alpha-Fe2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites were synthesized by a hydrothermal and pyrolysis method. The structure and morphology of the nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) techniques, which indicates porous alpha-Fe2O3 nanotubes wrapped by lamellar g-C3N4 structure. Due to the formation of heterojunctions, the alpha-Fe2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites demonstrate a better gas sensing performance than the pure alpha-Fe2O3 and g-C3N4. The alpha-Fe2O3/g-C3N4 heterojunctional composites with g-C3N4 60% weight present a maximum gas-sensing response of 7.76 toward 100 ppm ethanol at the optimum operating temperature of 340 degrees C, which is about 3 and 7 times higher than that of the pure alpha-Fe2O3 porous nanotubes and pure g-C3N4 nanopowders, respectively. Furthermore, the alpha-Fe2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites exhibit excellent selectivity to ethanol gas, faster response and recovery time than those of the pure alpha-Fe2O3 porous nanotubes and pure g-C3N4 powders. The possible reason for the enhanced sensing performance obtained from the alpha-Fe2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites is attributed to the porous alpha-Fe2O3 nanotubes wrapped by lamellar g-C3N4 nanostructures and the formation of heterojunction. The findings reported in this study will be useful to the design and construction of metal oxide nanostructures based heterojunctional structures with enhanced gas sensing performance.

Accelerating the Hole Mobility of Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution via 2D/2D Heterojunction Structural Advantages and Ni(OH)(2) Characteristic	Although photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is significant for solar conversion and energy supply, the photocatalytic efficiency is hampered by the low photoinduced holes mobility. Herein, the 2D Ni(OH)(2) as an operational cocatalyst is integrated with 2D graphitic carbon nitride (2D-CN) ultrafine to form a 2D/2D heterojunction to improve the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Due to the high mobility attribute of the Ni(OH)(2) holes and the unique 2D/2D heterojunction of Ni(OH)(2)/CN, the specific photocatalyst Ni(OH)(2)/2D-CN accelerates the photocarrier separation/transport, thereby achieving the breakthrough of continuous photocatalytic hydrogen evolution without using Pt cocatalyst and sacrificial agent. Above all, the as-obtained Ni(OH)(2)/2D-CN exhibits a hydrogen evolution rate of 921.4 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) with an external quantum efficiency of 5.21% at 400 nm using 10% triethanolamine as a sacrificial agent. The work provides a new research approach for the catalytic conversion of energy.
Amperometric detection of glucose based on immobilizing glucose oxidase on g-C3N4 nanosheets	2-dimensional graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets were synthesized from thiourea and urea through hydrothermal method, which was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and electrochemical techniques. Excellent biocompatibility of g-C3N4 makes its suitable for the sufficient immobilization of glucose oxidase with improved catalytic behavior. The electrochemical oxidation behavior of glucose was chosen as the model to study the sensing performance of GOx/g-C3N4 nanocomposite modified glassy carbon electrode in neutral condition. Several impact factors, such as the mixing ratio of g-C3N4 and GOx, the modified amount of GOx/g-C3N4 suspension, the applied potential, and the pH values, were investigated. Under the optimal condition, glucose can be linearly detected in the range of 50 mu M to 2 mM with the sensitivity of 21.7 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2). The detection limit was evaluated as 5 mu M with the signal-to-noise ratio of 3. The modified electrode exhibited good reproducibility and long-term stability, which is applicable for the detection of glucose in real samples.
A graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4/Fe3O4) nanocomposite: an efficient electrode material for the electrochemical determination of tramadol in human biological fluids	In the present study, a graphitic carbon nitride/Fe3O4 (g-C3N4/Fe3O4) nanocomposite/carbon paste electrode was used as a highly sensitive sensor for the voltammetric determination of tramadol (Tr) in an aqueous solution. The g-C3N4/Fe3O4 nanocomposite was synthesized by simple calcination of g-C3N4 and ferrite (Fe3O4) magnetic nanoparticles, which was then utilized to fabricate a modified carbon paste electrode (g-C3N4/Fe3O4-CPE). The nanocomposite was thoroughly characterized by various techniques including field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The effects of some parameters, such as the solution pH, scan rate, accumulation time and potential, interferents and concentration of Tr, were studied to optimize the experimental conditions; under the optimized conditions, the proposed electrode showed significant detection efficiency for Tr determined using differential pulse voltammetry over the concentration ranges of 0.2-14.0 mM and 14.0-120.0 mM and a detection limit of 0.1 mM. The proposed sensor was successfully applied for the determination of Tr in various real samples without any complex sample pretreatment.
Aldehyde dehydrogenase from human liver. Primary structure of the cytoplasmic isoenzyme	Analysis of CNBr fragments and other peptides from human liver cytoplasmic aldehyde dehydrogenase enabled determination of the complete primary structure of this protein. The monomer has an acylated amino terminus and is composed of 500 amino acid residues, including 11 cysteine residues. No evidence of any microheterogeneity was obtained, supporting the concept that the enzyme is a homotetramer . The disulfiram-sensitive thiol in the protein, earlier identified through its reaction with iodoacetamide, is contributed by a cysteine residue at position 302, while the cysteine which in horse liver mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase is reactive with coenzyme analogs appears to correspond to either Cys-455 or Cys-463. Analysis of glycine distribution and prediction of secondary structures to localize beta alpha beta regions typical for coenzyme-binding are not fully unambiguous, but suggest a short region around position 245 as a likely segment for this function. In this region, sequence similarities to parts of a bacterial aspartate-beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase and a mammalian alcohol dehydrogenase were noted. Otherwise, no extensive similarities were detected in comparisons with characterized mammalian enzymes of similar activity or subunit size as aldehyde dehydrogenase (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase, respectively).
Novel freestanding core-shell nanofibrillated cellulose/ polypyrrole/tubular graphitic carbon nitride composite film for supercapacitors electrodes	Polypyrrole, a conductive polymer, has been recognized as a promising material for preparing advanced energy storage devices. And an energy storage material based on tubular graphitic carbon nitride is introduced to fabricate supercapacitors electrodes. In this study, freestanding core-shell NFC/PPy/TGCN composite film was successfully fabricated by simple polymerization followed by vacuum-induced self-assembly. The obtained electrodes delivered high areal capacitance of 2.53 F cm(-2) at the current density of 5 mA cm(-2), equivalent to a specific capacitance of 158 F g(-1). The environmentally friendly aspects of the proposed method coupled with low-cost of fabrication and excellent electrochemical performances make it the future of energy storage devices.
Novel all-solid-state Z-scheme SnO2/Pt/In2O3 photocatalyst with boosted photocatalytic performance on water splitting and 2,4-dichlorophenol degradation under visible light	Fabricating Z-scheme photocatalytic system is of great significance for water splitting and degradation of organic pollutants. However, it is highly challenging to select suitable materials to form Z-scheme photocatalysis systems due to the harsh requirement for band edge levels alignment and interfacial contact. In this work, a novel all-solid-state Pt-bridge SnO2/Pt/In2O3 Z-scheme photocatalyst was prepared by an ingenious in situ deposition and photo-reduction protocol. The physicochemical properties of prepared materials were characterized via SEM, TEM, BET, DRS, PL, and EIS. It is revealed that the visible light absorption capacity of prepared composites was remarkably enhanced due to the localized surface plasma resonance effect of Pt nanoparticles. Moreover, such Pt nanoparticles act as the electron mediator of photogenerated carriers, and the photogenerated electron hole pairs of SnO2/Pt/In2O3 Z-scheme photocatalysts can be effectively separated, which hence reserving the most favorable reductive and oxidative reaction sites. The photocatalytic degradation efficiency of 2,4-dichlorophenol (50 mg L-1) over SnO2/Pt/In2O3 under visible light reaches 90% in 180 min, and the optimal photocatalytic H-2 generation rate reaches 967.018 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), respectively more than 9.36 and 19.40 times higher than that of pure In2O3 (103.358 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) and SnO2 (49.847 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)). In addition, the stability experiments showed that the H-2 generation rate of the SnO2/Pt/In2O3 Z-scheme photocatalyst after five cycles has only decreased by 8.96%. This work not only demonstrates a facile and eco-friendly strategy to prepare highly active and stable photocatalyst, but provides a new viewpoint about designing and constructing novel Z-scheme photocatalytic materials.
Synergetic effect of bio-photocatalytic hybrid system: g-C3N4 and Acinetobacter sp JLS1 for enhanced degradation of C-16 alkane	Petroleum hydrocarbons are ubiquitous in nature and generally lead to contamination. The aim of this study was to establish a bio-photocatalytic system using graphite-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and petroleum-degrading bacterium Acinetobacter sp. JLS1 and evaluate its effect on C-16 alkane degradation. The successfully synthesized g-C3N4 produced no obvious lethal effect to strain JLS1 until 1 g/L. C-16 alkane (0.25% v/v) degradation was investigated in the individual (photocatalytic or biocatalytic) and hybrid (bio-photocatalytic) systems. The C16 alkane removal efficiency of the hybrid system under visible light irradiation was 78.2% within 4 h, which was more effective than that of photocatalytic (26.8%) and biocatalytic (38.3%) systems. This positive synergetic effect between g-C3N4 and strain JLS1 was due to the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 for C-16 alkane degradation and increased porosity and permeability of bacterial membrane, thus facilitating the entry of targeted compound into bacterial cells. In the hybrid system, hexadecanoic acid, dodecanoic acid and octanoic acid were examined out in bacterial cells, which were biostransformed by strain JLS1 from initial C-16 alkane and its photocatalytic degradation products (alkanes with relative lower C atoms). In addition, alkB gene transcription was strongly upregulated by g-C3N4 under visible-light irradiation, however, growth of strain JLS1 slightly improved compared to that in other tested systems, suggesting that continuous attack of photocatalytic reaction constantly impeded the repair process of bacterial cell. The established effective bio-photocatalytic system not only drew a new sight for further research but also provided a promising remediation approach for dealing with petroleum hydrocarbons.

Hierarchical nanocomposites of polyaniline nanorods arrays on graphitic carbon nitride sheets with synergistic effect for photocatalysis	
Palladium Nanoparticles/Graphitic Carbon Nitride Nanosheets-Carbon Nanotubes as a Catalytic Amplification Platform for the Selective Determination of 17α-ethinylestradiol in Feedstuffs	A new kind of nanocomposite, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)-carbon nanotubes (CNTs), has been synthesized via solid grinding, and followed by thermal polymerization process of melamine and CNTs. Pd nanoparticles were loaded on the as-prepared nanocomposite by the self-assembly method. The Pd/g-C3N4-CNTs nanocomposite exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), and compared with other detection methods of EE2, such as HPLC, this detection platform does not need the samples for further purification processing. And this detection platform was compared with HPLC, there is no significant difference between two methods, and the accuracy and precision of the determination of EE2 in feedstuff sample by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) to a satisfactory level. Thus, the Pd/g-C3N4-CNTs nanocomposite can be used as a signal amplification platform for the detection of EE2 in feedstuffs samples. Under the optimum condition, the current response increased linearly with EE2 concentration from 2.0 × 10-6 ~ 1.5 × 10-4 M with a detection limit of 5.0 × 10-7 M (S/N = 3) by DPV. The Pd/g-C3N4-CNTs showed good reproducibility and excellent anti-interference ability that the relative standard deviation was 3.3% (n = 5). This strategy may find widespread and promising applications in other sensing systems involving EE2.
A rapid microwave synthesis of nanoscale BiVO4/Si2O3@SiO2 with large specific surface area and excellent visible-light-driven activity	The photocatalyst BiVO4/Bi2O3@SiO2 nanoparticle was synthesized in a high-pressured microwave method. The as-prepared photocatalytst was characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The visible-light-driven activity of the prepared photocatalyst was evaluated by degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB). The results show that the as-prepared sample appears in a core-shell structure with the heterojunction BiVO4/Bi2O3 as core and amorphous porous SiO2 as shell. BiVO4/Bi2O3@SiO2 has a large specific surface area (99.63 m(2) g(-1)) and exhibits superior photocatalytic activity in the degradation of RhB under visible-light illumination. The degradation rate constant of RhB over BiVO4/Bi2O3@SiO2 are 9.8, 9.0, 8.4, and 5.6 times as high as that over Bi2O3, BiVO4, BiVO4/Bi2O3 and BiVO4/SiO2, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of BiVO4/Bi2O3@SiO2 is attributed to both high surface area and low recombination rate of photoinduced electron hole pairs. The high surface area provides more active sites and superior adsorption properties, which promotes the photocatalytic activity. The low recombination rate of photoinduced electron-hole pairs is due to both the hetero-junction between BiVO4 and Bi2O3 and the presence of impurity level of SiO2.
A nanohybrid composed of Prussian Blue and graphitic C3N4 nanosheets as the signal-generating tag in an enzyme-free electrochemical immunoassay for the neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin	An enzyme-free electrochemical immunoassay is described for the neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL; a biomarker of kidney disease). Prussian Blue (PB) nanoparticles with redox activity were deposited on graphitic C3N4 nanosheets (g-C3N4) by in-situ reduction. A screen printed electrode (SPCE) was modified with antibody against NGAL, and the PB-g-C3N4 nanohybrid was used as the signal-generating tag for the secondary antibody against NGAL. Upon addition of target NGAL and of secondary antibody, a sandwich is formed on the SPCE. At an applied potential of typically 0.13 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), a well-defined voltammetric peak is observed that results from the presence of PB on the secondary antibody. Under optimal conditions, the peak current increases linearly in the 0.01 to 10 ng·mL-1 NGAL concentration range, and the detection limit is 2.8 pg·mL-1. An average precision of <12% was accomplished in the batch-to-batch mode. Other disease-related biomarkers do not interfere. The accuracy and inter-laboratory validation of this method were evaluated for target NGAL detection in spiked human serum by using a commercial ELISA. The results obtained by the two methods are in good accordance. Graphical abstract An enzyme-free electrochemical immunoassay was used for detection of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin by Prussian blut/graphitic-C3N4 nanohybrids as the signal-generation tags.
Keggin heteropolyacid supported on BN and C3N4: Comparison between catalytic and photocatalytic alcohol dehydration	The Keggin heteropolyacid (HPA), H3PW12O40(PW12) has been supported on commercial boron nitride (BN) and two types of home prepared carbon nitride (C3N4). The supported PW12 was used in the gas-solid (photo)catalytic 2-propanol dehydration reaction to give propene at atmospheric pressure and temperatures in the range 70-120 degrees C and resulted more active than the pristine PW12. Reaction rate increased by increasing the temperature. Noticeably, the propene formation rate was higher by irradiating the catalytic system. The PW12/BN material resulted more active than PW12/C3N4. The acidity of the HPA cluster accounts for the catalytic role, whereas both the acidity and the redox properties of the HPA species were responsible for the increase of the reaction rate in the photo-assisted catalytic reaction.
Synthesis of zinc ferrite/silver iodide composite with enhanced photocatalytic antibacterial and pollutant degradation ability	ZnFe2O4/Agl composites were first prepared successfully with a hydrothermal method, and ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles were uniformly decorated on the surface of Agl particles. The photocatalytic activities of the obtained ZnFe2O4/Agl composites were investigated by the degradation of organic pollutants and the inactivation of bacteria under visible light irradiation. The results showed that the introduction of ZnFe2O4 greatly enhanced the light harvesting ability and improved the separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers, which contributed to the enhanced generation of reactive species and thus promoted the photocatalytic performance. The 5% ZnFe2O4/Agl composite exhibited the optimal photo catalytic disinfection of E. coli (100% removal efficiency in 80 min) as well as the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) (98.5% removal rate in 40 min). Furthermore, four consecutive cycles also demonstrated the stable photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared ZnFe2O4/Agl composites. In addition, H2O2 was identified as the predominant active species in the photocatalytic inactivation of bacteria. This study indicated that ZnFe2O4/Agl composites are a promising candidate for the treatment of wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
POSSIBILITY OF CARBON NITRIDE FORMATION BY LOW-ENERGY NITROGEN IMPLANTATION INTO GRAPHITE - IN-SITU ELECTRON-SPECTROSCOPY STUDIES	The possibility of carbon nitride formation by low-energy nitrogen ion irradiation of graphite was investigated by in situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Room-temperature and hot 500-eV N-2(+) implantations were performed with saturation doses for which a constant nitrogen concentration was obtained. Analysis of the N(1s) core level line indicates the existence of three different carbon-nitrogen bonding states in the room-temperature implanted layer. Annealing experiments up to 500 degrees C revealed a slight, gradual decrease of nitrogen concentration in the implanted layer accompanied by a partial redistribution of the nitrogen bonding states. Hot nitrogen implantations at 300 and 500 degrees C resulted in a predominant population of the more covalent, with higher N(1s) binding energy, nitrogen bonding state. Such a distribution of carbon-nitrogen chemical bonds could not have been obtained by annealing of the room-temperature implanted layer. These results may be of importance in finding a way to produce the elusive beta-C3N4 phase by ion beam assisted deposition.
Fabrication of Ag/carbon nitride photocatalysts and their enhanced photocatalytic performance for tetracycline degradation	In this study, we synthesized graphic carbon nitride nanosheets (labeled as CNs) by solid-phase grinding strategy coupled calcination method and then prepared Ag nanoparticles (NPs) loaded CNs composites by photodeposition. The as-prepared Ag/CNs composites presented remarkably enhanced photocatalytic performance and the degradation rate of tetracycline (TC) by Ag/CNs (3 wt.%) composite is above two times higher than that by pristine CNs under visible light irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic activity originated from the close contact between Ag and CNs, and the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of Ag. Moreover, the results of radical trapping experiments illustrated that center dot O-2(-) plays a dominant role in photocatalytic degradation of TC. This work provides a new way for design novel noble metal modified graphic CN photocatalysts.
Intrinsic electric field assisted polymeric graphitic carbon nitride coupled with Bi4Ti3O12/Bi2Ti2O7 heterostructure nanofibers toward enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution	Polymeric carbon nitride as a low-cost and robust photocatalyst has been limited by the rapid recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs and low visible light utilization efficiency. It is demonstrated a ternary heterostructured photocatalyst polymeric graphitic carbon nitride (for simplicity, g-C3N4) coupled with Bi4Ti3O12/Bi2Ti2O7 (BTO) by a simple route of electrospinning/calcination. This optimal photocatalyst shows efficient reproducible hydrogen evolution (638 mu molh(-1) g(-1)) under visible light, which is about 7.6 times higher than BTO and 1.55 times higher than g-C3N4. The optimal loading of BTO nanorods on g-C3N4 increases light absorption to generate more photoelectrons and simultaneously promotes separation and transfer of photoinduced electrons and holes, which arises from the intrinsic electric field formed between the (Bi2O2)(2+) slabs and the (Bim-1TiO3m+1) units in Bi2Ti2O7 and Bi4Ti3O12. On the basis of further obtained temperature dependent experimental results through the Arrhenius relationship, mechanism of temperature dependent spontaneous polarization is proposed. This study offers new insight into the design of efficient ternary heterostructured advanced materials for water treatment to resolve the energy crisis problem.

Noble-Metal-Free NiS/C3N4 for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution from Water	A NiS/C3N4 photocatalyst containing earth-abundant elements only was constructed by means of a simple hydrothermal method. This photocatalyst shows efficient hydrogen evolution (48.2molh(-1)) under visible light when using triethanolamine as a sacrificial reagent. The optimal loading of 1.1wt% NiS on C3N4 as a cocatalyst can enhance the H-2 production by about 250times compared with the native C3N4. The highest apparent quantum efficiency of 1.9% was recorded at 440nm.
Synergetic photocatalytic ozonation using modified graphitic carbon nitride for treatment of emerging contaminants under UVC, UVA and visible irradiation	This work unmask the ability of modified graphitic carbon nitride photocatalysts in terms of both degradation and mineralization of bisphenol A (BPA, 50 mg/L) as well as carbamazepine (CBZ, 10 mg/L) as visible-light insensitive pollutants by integrated photocatalytic ozonation treatment. The effects of different light irradiation wavelengths i.e., 80 W UVC (lambda= 254 nm), 80 W UVA (lambda= 352 nm) as well as 3 W LED (lambda = 460 nm) on the mineralization/degradation of BPA were also discussed in detail. A series of Fe2O3 (x)/ S-doped g-C3N4, Fe(x)CNS, nanocomposites with diverse Fe2O3 contents (x = 0.5, 4.3, and 14.8 wt%) were synthesized using an one-step process. It was found that the treatment technique Fe(4.3)CNS/O-3/LED did not selectively mineralize BPA because it also showed a high mineralization efficiency for degradation of the CBZ contaminant. These findings suggest superior treatment processes with various advantages and provide an insight to graphitic carbon nitride-based photocatalysts and their use in pilot scale.

NH2-UiO-66/g-C3N4/CdTe composites for photocatalytic CO2 reduction under visible light	To boost the photocatalytic activity of NH2-UiO-66 toward CO2 under visible light, CdTe quantum dots and g-C3N4 nanocrystals were introduced to form NH2-UiO-66/g-C3N4/CdTe composites via a two-step synthetic strategy. g-C3N4 and CdTe in different visible light ranges possessed a strong absorption ability, and, thereby, greatly extended the range of photoresponsive wavelength of the composites. Mott-Schottky analysis revealed that the energy level of the conduction band of g-C3N4 and CdTe was higher than the LUMO level of NH2-UiO-66, benefiting for the photogenerated carriers separation and electron injection from g-C3N4 and CdTe to NH2-UiO-66, leading to a high concentrated Zr (III) formation. Finally, the NH2-UiO-66/g-C3N4/CdTe composites exhibited the superior photocatalytic performance for CO2 conversion in the acetonitrile/ethanol system upon visible light irradiation (>= 400 nm) with a HCOOH generation rate of 24.6 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) that was similar to 7.5 times higher than that of NH2-UiO-66 alone.

Dissociation of cyanogen azide: An alternative route to synthesis of carbon nitride	Solid films composed principally of carbon and nitrogen were grown on a variety of substrates at ambient temperature in a flow-tube reactor by upstream mixing of cyanogen azide, cyanogen, or cyanogen halides with active nitrogen obtained from an electrical discharge. Ab initio calculations and dependence of deposition rates on both choice of donor and N atom production suggests that NCN radicals are a critical growth species. The films obtained are electrically insulating with a refractive index of 2.3 at visible wavelength and are optically transparent from 550 nm out to at least 14 mu m with the exception of two broad absorption bands centered at 1550 and 3250 cm(-1), the latter band growing in upon exposure of the film to atmospheric moisture. Film analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed comparable concentrations of both carbon-to-nitrogen bonds (with approximate C3N4 stoichiometry) and diamond-like carbon-to-carbon bonds as well as minority bonding of carbon to impurities.
Bifunctional Cu3P Decorated g-C3N4 Nanosheets as a Highly Active and Robust Visible-Light Photocatalyst for H-2 Production	The rational design of sustainable noble-metal-free heterojunctions remains a key challenge for highly efficient and durable photocatalytic H-2 production. In this study, it was revealed that the robust copper phosphide (Cu3P) nanoparticles may serve as a cocatalyst and a p type semiconductor at low (1.5 wt %) and high (10 wt %) loading contents, respectively. Both Cu3P cocatalyst and semiconductor could evidently boost visible-light-driven photocatalytic H-2 production over graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets. Comparably speaking, the heterojunction effects between p-type Cu3P and n-type g-C3N4 are speculated to play a more prominent role in dramatically boosting photocatalytic H-2 production than the electron-sink roles of surface Cu3P cocatalysts. Impressively, among all the as-fabricated photocatalysts, high quality 10 wt % g-C3N4 Cu3P could achieve the highest photocatalytic H-2-production rate of 159.41 pmol which is approximately 1014 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4. In cycling experiments, g-C3N4-10 wt % Cu3P exhibited an acceptable photostability. More importantly, it was further demonstrated that earth-abundant dual-functional Cu3P nanoparticles could markedly facilitate the separation of electron hole pairs and H-2-evolution kinetics, thus achieving distinctly boosted photocatalytic H-2 generation. This work will provide new insights into the rational design of environmentally friendly gC3N4-based hybrid nanoheterojunctions for visible-light-responsive photocatalytic H-2 generation through loading noble-metal free bifunctional cocatalysts on semiconductors.
Synthesis and Application of a Powerful Heterogeneous Photo-Fenton Catalyst Based on rGO/g-C3N4/Fe3O4/tiO(2) Nano-Composite for the Removal of Sewage Contaminants	The reduced GO/g-CN/Fe3O4 nano-composite was prepared by the co-precipitation of pre-hydrolyses ferric and ferrous salts in the presence of GO/g-CN hybrid. Structural and morphological characterization of the synthesized rGO/g-CN/Fe3O4/TiO2 nano-composite were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. Their photo-Fenton catalytic performance under UV-visible light irradiation was evaluated by UV-vis spectrophotometry and electrochemical methods. The influence of heterogeneous catalyst composition on the MB degradation efficiency was examined and optimized. The highest MB degradation efficiency of ternary rGO/g-CN/Fe3O4 was 53% under UV light. Addition of nano TiO2 to the nanocomposite effectively improved its photo-Fenton degradation efficiency (up to 97% within 20 min). As excellent conductive carrier, rGO connected g-CN to TiO2 and effectively separated photo-created electrons and holes. Uniform dispersion of g-CN on the rGO surface caused full harvest of incident light and more efficient interaction with pollutants. The significant improvement of photo-Fenton catalytic effect of rGO/g-CN/Fe3O4/TiO2 is attributed to the synergetic interaction and availability of the active catalytic centers that effectively facilitated the Fe3+/Fe2+ recycling. Experimental results confirmed the promising dual purpose application, photo-Fenton and adsorption properties of rGO/g-CN/Fe3O4/TiO2 nano-composite in wastewater treatment.

Panulirus interruptus hemocyanin. The elucidation of the complete amino acid sequence of subunit a	As a final step in the elucidation of the primary structure of subunit a of Panulirus interruptus hemocyanin (657 residues, Mr 75696 excluding two copper ions and carbohydrate), the amino acid sequence of the largest fragment obtained by limited trypsinolysis was determined. The elucidation of the sequence of residues 176-657, comprising domains two and three, was mainly based on two digests, with CNBr and trypsin, respectively, from both of which a complete set of peptides was obtained. Additional sequence information was obtained from a digest with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and from one fragment obtained by cleaving subunit a with hydroxylamine. A block during Edman degradations indicated an Asn-Gly sequence at positions 597-598, although only aspartic acid was identified at position 597.
Amino acid sequence around the thiol and reactive acyl groups of human complement component C4	Activation of the fourth component of complement (C4) by C1s results in the generation of a reactive acyl group, able to react with putrescine, and in the release of a free thiol group that cannot be detected in the native haemolytically active molecule. Both the reactive acyl group and the free thiol group have been shown to reside in C4d, a fragment of the alpha'-chain of C4b derived from digestion of the molecule with the control proteins C3b inactivator and C4-binding protein. Peptides derived from CNBr digestion of [1,4-14C]putrescine-labelled and iodo(2-14C]acetic acid-labelled C4d have been obtained and used to establish a continuous sequence of 88 residues from the N-terminus of the molecule. The thiol and reactive acyl groups are contained in an octapeptide that shows near identity with the equivalent sequences reported for alpha 2-macroglobulin and C3. Other adjacent short sections also show homology of sequence between the three proteins, and it is highly likely that they contribute to the overall structure that gives a unique reactivity to the thiol ester bond postulated to exist in the native forms of the three proteins.
Interface Engineering of MoS 2 -Modified Graphitic Carbon Nitride Nano-photocatalysts for an Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction	Understanding of photochemical charge transfer processes at nanoscale heterojunctions is essential in developing effective catalysts. Here, we utilize a controllable synthesis method and a combination of optical absorption, photoluminescence, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic studies to investigate the effect of MoS2 nanosheet lateral dimension and edge length size on the photochemical behavior of MoS2 -modified graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3 N4 ) heterojunctions. These nano-heterostructures, which comprise interlayer junctions with variable area (i. e., MoS2 lateral size ranges from 18 nm to 52 nm), provide a size-tunable interfacial charge transfer through the MoS2 /g-C3 N4 contacts, while exposing a large fraction of surface MoS2 edge sites available for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Importantly, modification of g-C3 N4 with MoS2 layers of 39±5 nm lateral size (20 wt % loading) creates interfacial contacts with relatively large number of MoS2 edge sites and efficient electronic transport phenomena, yielding a high photocatalytic H2 -production activity of 1497 μmol h-1 gcat -1 and an apparent QY of 3.3 % at 410 nm light irradiation. This study thus offers a design strategy to improve light energy conversion efficiency of catalysts by engineering interfaces at the nanoscale in 2D-layered heterojunction materials.
Double-Shell and Flower-Like ZnS-C3N4 Derived from in Situ Supramolecular Self-Assembly for Selective Aerobic Oxidation of Amines to Imines	Multishelled micro-/nanostructures have attracted much research attention because of their unique properties. It is a big challenge to fabricate multishelled hollow structures of complex nanoarchitectures with the respective shells different in composition. Herein, the double-shell and flower-like ZnS-C3N4 (2-ZSCN) was fabricated by a facile supramolecular self-assembly method. Because of its unique structure, 2-ZSCN exhibits enhanced photocatalytic activity and stability in the selective aerobic oxidation of amines to imines under visible-light irradiation.
Studies on algal cytochromes. III. Amino acid sequence of cytochrome c-553 from a brown alga, Petalonia fascia	The amino acid sequence of a photosynthetic cytochrome c-553 isolated from a brown alga, Petalonia fascia was determined by BrCN fragmentation and a solid phase Edman degradation. The cytochrome contains 85 amino acid residues, giving a molecular weight of 9,803. The complete amino acid sequence is as follows: Val-Asp-Ile-Asn-Asn-Gly-Glu-Ser-Val-Phe-Thr-Ala-Asn-Cys-Ser-Ala-Cys-His-Ala-Gly -Gly-Asn-Asn-Val-Ile-Met-Pro-Glu-Lys-Thr-Leu-Lys-Lys-Asp-Ala-Leu-Glu-Glu-Asn-Gl u-Met-Asn-Asn-Ile-Lys-Ser-Ile-Thr-Tyr-Gln-Val-Thr-Asn-Gly-Lys-Asn-Ala-Met-Pro-A la-Phe-Gly-Gly-Arg-Leu-Ser-Glu-Thr-Asp-Ile-Glu-Asp-Val-Ala-Asn-Phe-Val-Ile-Ser-Gln-Ser-Gln-Lys-Gly-Trp. The highest homology was found between the sequences of cytochromes c-553 of P. fascia and Alaria esculenta, the next between those of P. fascia and Porphyria tenera.
Antigenic structure of adenylate kinase from porcine skeletal muscle--II. Immunochemical cross-reactivity of fragments from adenylate kinase	Specific antibody to a fragment [CBb(2-56)] of porcine muscle adenylate kinase was purified from goat antiserum against adenylate kinase on an immunoadsorbent column. This anti-CBb antibody cross-reacted in solid phase radioimmunoassay with two other CNBr-fragments of adenylate kinase, CBfN(81-125) and CBfC(126-194). This cross-reactivity explained their high inhibition activities in quantitative precipitin reaction between adenylate kinase and goat antiserum shown in the previous work. Cysteinyl residues of the enzyme (positions 25 and 187) were S-cyanylated with 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid and the enzyme was cleaved at these residues. Fragment 1-24 thus obtained was purified. The fragment 1-24, composing the N-terminal half of CBb(2-56), accounted for full activity of CBb to anti-CBb in radioimmunoassay. Hence antigenic region(s) of CBb(2-56) exist in its N-terminal half, 2-24, and this determinant(s) may be closely related to the cross-reactivity among CB-fragments. CBfN also bound to the antibody fraction which had not been adsorbed to CBb-Sepharose (non-anti-CBb). CBfN carried additional antigenic regions. In conclusion, we propose that the antigenic reactive region(s) of adenylate kinase responsible for the cross-reactivity of the CB-fragments are as follows: -Glu-Glu-Lys-Leu-Lys-Lys- (2-7), -Glu-Glu-Phe-Lys-Arg-Lys- (103-108), -Glu-Glu-Thr-Ile-Lys-Lys- (143-148).
Direct synthesis of nanoporous carbon nitride fibers using Al-based porous coordination polymers (Al-PCPs)	We report a new synthetic route for preparation of nanoporous carbon nitride fibers with graphitic carbon nitride polymers, by calcination of Al-based porous coordination polymers (Al-PCPs) with dicyandiamide (DCDA) under a nitrogen atmosphere.
Eukaryote-specific motif of ribosomal protein S15 neighbors A site codon during elongation and termination of translation	The eukaryotic ribosomal protein S15 is a key component of the decoding site in contrast to its prokaryotic counterpart, S19p, which is located away from the mRNA binding track on the ribosome. Here, we determined the oligopeptide of S15 neighboring the A site mRNA codon on the human 80S ribosome with the use of mRNA analogues bearing perfluorophenyl azide-modified nucleotides in the sense or stop codon targeted to the 80S ribosomal A site. The protein was cross-linked to mRNA analogues in specific ribosomal complexes that were obtained in the presence of eRF1 in the experiments with mRNAs bearing stop codon. Digestion of modified S15 with various specific proteolytic agents followed by identification of the resulting modified oligopeptides showed that cross-link was in C-terminal fragment in positions 131-145, most probably, in decapeptide 131-PGIGATHSSR-140. The position of cross-linking site on the S15 protein did not depend on the nature of the A site-bound codon (sense or stop codon) and on the presence of polypeptide chain release factor eRF1 in the ribosomal complexes with mRNA analogues bearing a stop codon. The results indicate an involvement of the mentioned decapeptide in the formation of the ribosomal decoding site during elongation and termination of translation. Alignment of amino acid sequences of eukaryotic S15 and its prokaryotic counterpart, S19p from eubacteria and archaea, revealed that decapeptide PGIGATHSSR in positions 131-140 is strongly conserved in eukaryotes and has minor variations in archaea but has no homology with any sequence in C-terminal part of eubacterial S19p, which suggests involvement of the decapeptide in the translation process in a eukaryote-specific manner.
Integration of a Photo-Fenton Reaction and a Membrane Filtration using CS/PAN@FeOOH/g-C3N4Electrospun Nanofibers: Synthesis, Characterization, Self-cleaning Performance and Mechanism	Membrane fouling has always been a problem restricting the industrial applications of membrane technology. We synthesized FeOOH/g-C3N4 submicron particles exhibiting a visible light response and PAN(poly-acrylonitrile)@FeOOH/g-C3N4 nanofibers by electrospinning. By coating a dense, smooth and nondestructive layer of chitosan (CS) on the surface of the support layer, a highly hydrophilic CS/PAN@FeOOH/g-C3N4 membrane with self-cleaning ability was successfully prepared. The mechanistic studies revealed that the hydroxyl radicals (OH) produced by the photo-Fenton reactions are the main agents responsible for the degradation of contaminants. Compared with the use of the CS/PAN@FeOOH/g-C3N4 membrane alone, the addition of photo-Fenton reactions could effectively recover the water flux of the membrane polluted by methylene blue and erythromycin, and increase the rejections. In this study, the electrospun membrane was combined with a photo-Fenton reaction for the first time, and this combination provides a new alternative solution for membrane fouling mitigation.
A facile in-situ hydrothermal route to construct a well-aligned beta-Ag2MoO4/g-C3N4 heterojunction with enhanced visible light photodegradation: Mechanistic views	Constructing a well-aligned heterojunction composite and realizing its photocatalysis mechanism are pivotal in controlling the charge transfer behavior and in turn improving the photocatalytic ability of a photocatalyst. Herein, we report an in situ synthesis of an efficient heterostructured beta-Ag2MoO4/g-C3N4 composite by hydrothermal method. The structural and morphological studies revealed that beta-Ag2MoO4 nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed on the surface of isolated g-C3N4 nanosheets. The photocatalytic abilities and photocatalytic mechanism of beta-Ag2MoO4/g-C3N4 composites were evaluated towards degradation of MO under visible light. The different compositions of beta-Ag2MoO4/g-C3N4 composites were studied for their photocatalytic activities in order to get optimal composition. Photocatalytic efficiency of beta-Ag2MoO4/g-C3N4 composite is much higher than that of the pristine beta-Ag2MoO4 and g-C3N4. Photocatalytic mechanism of heterostructured beta-Ag2MoO4/g-C3N4 composite was discussed in detail with the support of photoluminescence spectra and reactive species trapping experiments. Intimately contacted interfaces with well staggered band alignment of beta-Ag2MoO4/g-C3N4 composite enhance the charge separation and reduction in the probability of electron-hole pair recombination under visible light irradiation and so a significant improvement of the photocatalytic ability. The present work offers to understand the heterojunction mechanism for constructing the efficient composites with remarkable photocatalytic efficiency.
Activating Oxygen Molecules over Carbonyl-Modified Graphitic Carbon Nitride: Merging Supramolecular Oxidation with Photocatalysis in a Metal-Free Catalyst for Oxidative Coupling of Amines into Imines	Carbonyl-modified carbon nitride (m-O=C3N4) can act as a highly efficient metal-free photocatalyst for selective oxidation reactions, as exemplified herein by the oxidative coupling of amines to imines by using dioxygen molecules and visible light. The C=O groups built-in on the surface of the material significantly boosted the activity by following the principle of supramolecular oxidation, that is, they largely promoted the oxidation reaction at room temperature by binding in situ formed H2O2 photogenerated on the surface from the dioxygen molecules and accelerated the reaction between H2O2 and the amines.
High-performance liquid affinity chromatography of beta-lactamase	New silica and organic polymer-based, wide-pore, affinity chromatographic phases have been developed for beta-lactamase purification. The resins have been evaluated in terms of binding capacity, ligand coverage, protein recovery and long-term stability of activated resins prior to ligand attachment. The columns have been applied to the isolation of beta-lactamase from fermentation media. Protein purity following high-performance liquid affinity chromatography was assessed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
Investigation of Mesoporous Graphitic Carbon Nitride as the Adsorbent to Remove Ni (II) Ions	The mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (mpg-C3N4/r, r was defined as the initial silica/dicyandiamide mass ratio) was successfully synthesized by heating the mixture of silica and dicyandiamide in a nitrogen atmosphere. The morphology and structure of mpg-C3N4/r were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area measurement (BET), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The adsorption performances of Ni (II) ions by mpg-C3N4/r were investigated. With increasing of r value, the BET specific surface area of the synthesized mpg-C3N4/r increased; the highest specific surface area of mpg-C3N4/1.5 increased up to 169.3 m2/g. This work shows that mpg-C3N4/1.5 is a promising, high-efficiency adsorbent that can be used to purify the water of a low Ni (II) ions concentration. The maximum adsorption capacity of Ni(II) ions by mpg-C3N4/1.5 was 15.26 mg/g. The adsorption properties of Ni (II) ions by mpg-C3N4/r complied well with pseudo-second-order kinetics and Langmuir isotherm model.
Synthesis of g-C3N4/Ag3PO4 heterojunction with enhanced photocatalytic performance	g-C3N4/Ag3PO4 heterojunction photocatalyst with visible-light response was prepared by a facile coprecipitation method. The photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activities of the obtained samples were tested by using Rhodamine B (RhB) as the degradation target under visible light irradiation. g-C3N4/Ag3PO4 decomposed RhB, more effectively than the pure Ag3PO4 particles did, and 2 wt.% g-C3N4 had the highest activity. Furthermore, 2 wt.% g-C3N4/Ag3PO4 degraded high-concentration RhB more potently than unmodified Ag3PO4 did, probably because g-C3N4/Ag3PO4 heterojunction photocatalyst enhanced the photocatalytic activity by efficiently separating the photogenerated electron-hole pairs.

Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and bacterial inactivation utilizing sonochemical-synthesized g-C3N4/red phosphorus hybrid nanosheets as a wide-spectral-responsive photocatalyst: The role of type I band alignment	Efficient sunlight harvesting is imperative in the design of ideal photocatalysts for both environmental and energy applications. In this study, a wide-spectral-responsive photocatalyst composited of g-C3N4/red P (CNP) hybrid nanosheets was developed by a one-step "green" sonochemical method at room temperature. Ultrasound irradiation causes exfoliation of the layered g-C3N4, downsizing the red P particles and anchoring them onto the g-C3N4 nanosheets to form intimate CNP heterojunctions. As a dual active center photocatalyst, the CNP heterostructures exhibit significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity both for H-2 evolution and bacterial inactivation under visible light irradiation. In addition, the responsive wavelength of this new-fabricated photo catalyst can be extended to 700 nm. The crucial role of type I band alignment between g-C3N4 and red P is illuminated to facilitate the interface charge separation and extend the light response by efficiently utilizing the photogenerated e(-) excited from both g-C3N4 and red P. Moreover, a direct h(+) oxidation mechanism rather than a e- reduction mechanism is also found for bacterial inactivation under anaerobic conditions. This work provides a general strategy to fabricate novel metal-free heterostructures with wide-spectral-responsive photocatalytic activity by taking advantage of the type I band alignment combined with the narrow band gap feature of elemental red P.
TiO2 nanofibers embedded with g-C3N4 nanosheets and decorated with Ag nanoparticles as Z-scheme photocatalysts for environmental remediation	Here, we report synergistic sensitization of electrospun TiO2 nanofibers (TNFs) by heterojunction formation with exfoliated g-C3N4 nanosheets and decorated with Ag nanoparticles (NPs) uniformly over its surface for enhanced photocatalytic activity in simulated solar light. These composite catalysts displayed first-order rate constants of 0.087 min(-1) and 0.031 min(-1) for photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) and photoreduction of Cr(VI) under simulated sunlight which is 75% and 87% higher than the pristine TNFs, respectively, and better than the previously reported results for similar materials. Moreover, 99% of E. coli. and 83% S. aureus were inactivated after 60 min of irradiation. The enhanced activities of these prepared ternary composite nanofibers are attributed to the effective Z-scheme heterojunction formation between TiO2 and g-C3N4 due to the preferred band positions which facilitates the charge transfer and inhibit the recombination of charge carriers. Moreover, visible-light harvesting, charge separation and antimicrobial nature of these nanofibers were promoted by the Ag NPs due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect.
Visible-light-driven removal of tetracycline antibiotics and reclamation of hydrogen energy from natural water matrices and wastewater by polymeric carbon nitride foam	Water and energy are key sustainability issues that need to be addressed. Photocatalysis represents an attractive means to not only remediate polluted waters, but also harness solar energy. Unfortunately, the employment of photocatalysts remains a practical challenge in terms of high cost, low efficiency, secondary pollution and unexploited water matrices influence. This study investigated the feasibility of photocatalysis to both treat water and produce hydrogen with practical water systems. Polymeric carbon nitride foam (CNF) with large surface area and mesoporous structure was successfully prepared via the bubble-template effect of ammonium chloride decomposition during thermal condensation. The reaction kinetics, mechanisms, and effect of natural water matrices and wastewater on CNF-based photocatalytic removal of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-HCl) were systematically investigated. Furthermore, the efficiency of clean hydrogen energy from natural water matrices and wastewater was also evaluated. It was found that the photocatalytic performance of CNF for TC-HCl removal was principally affected by calcination temperature in the presence of NH4Cl. The degradation rates of CNF-4 (calcined at 550 °C) were approximately 1.84, 2.49 and 7.47 times than that of the CNF-2 (calcined at 600 °C), CNF-1 (calcined at 500 °C) and GCN (without NH4Cl), respectively. Results indicate that the improved photocatalytic performance was predominantly ascribed to the large specific surface area, increased availability of exposed active sites, and enhanced transport and separation efficiency of the photogenerated carrier. Based on electron spin resonance, chemical trapping experiment and density functional theory calculation, photoinduced oxidizing species (·O2- and holes) initially attacked the C-N-C fragment of TC molecules, which were finally mineralized to CO2, water and inorganic matters. Under the synergistic influence of water constituents (including acidity and alkalinity, ion species and dissolved organic substances), various water matrices greatly affected the degradation rate of TC-HCl, with the highest removal efficiency of 78.9% in natural seawater, followed by reservoir water (75.0%), tap water (62.3%), deionized water (49.8%), reverse osmosis concentrate (32.7%) and pharmaceutical wastewater (18.9%). Interestingly, low amounts of the emerging microplastics slightly improved TC-HCl removal, whereas high amounts (1.428 × 107 P/cm3) restricted removal due to light absorption and the intrinsic adsorption interaction. Moreover, the photocatalysts were able over repeated usage. Notably, the hydrogen yields rates of polymeric carbon nitride foam were 352.2, 299.8, 184.9 and 94.3 μmol/g/h in natural seawater, pharmaceutical wastewater, water from reservoir and tap water, respectively. This study proves the potential of novel nonmetal porous photocatalyst to simultaneously treat wastewater while converting solar energy into clean hydrogen energy.
g-C3N4Derivative Artificial Organic/Inorganic Composite Solid Electrolyte Interphase Layer for Stable Lithium Metal Anode	Lithium metal anodes are one of the most promising anodes in "next-generation" rechargeable batteries. However, continuous dendrite growth and interface instability of the anode have prevented practical applications. Constructing an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is an effective way to solve these issues. Herein, an artificial organic/inorganic SEI layer (denoted as N-organic/Li3N) is designed, consisting of Li(2)CN(2)and Li3N phases, to achieve stable cycling of Li metal electrodes. Density functional theory (DFT) results reveal that the N-organic/Li3N layer with a high Li ionic conductivity can effectively facilitate the transport of Li ions across the electrode surface and lead to uniform Li ionic flux on Li electrodes via strong interactions between Li ions and N-organic groups, resulting in dendrite-free Li stripping/plating. The N-organic/Li3N-coated Li (denoted as N-organic/Li3N@Li) anode delivers stable long-term cycling performance over 1100 h with a fixed areal capacity of 2 mAh cm(-2)under 1 mA cm(-2). A full battery assembled with a LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2(NCM622) cathode displays better long-term cycle performance when the N-organic/Li3N@Li composite anode is applied. The advantages of the organic/inorganic artificial SEI provide important insights into the design principles of SEI for lithium metal anodes.

Peroxymonosulfate-enhanced photocatalysis by carbonyl-modified g-C3N4 for effective degradation of the tetracycline hydrochloride	In this work, carbonyl-modified g-C3N4 (CO-C3N4) is prepared through one-step calcination of the melamine-oxalic acid aggregates. The visible light-assisted photocatalytic degradation efficiency of the tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH) for CO-C(3)N4 is significantly enhanced by introducing the peroxymonosulfate (PMS), and the apparent rate constant is greatly increased from 0.01966 min(-1) in CO-C3N4/vis system to 0.07688 min(-1) in CO-C3N4/PMS/vis system. It is found that carbonyl for CO-C3N4 might offer possible reactive sites for PMS activation and collection sites of photo-generated electrons, greatly accelerating carrier's separation for PMS activation. The favorable conditions, such as the higher catalyst dosage, higher PMS amount and alkaline pH, contribute to TCH degradation. The deleterious effects of co-existing anions on the TCH degradation efficiency are ranked in a decline: H2PO4- > SO42- > HCO3- > NO3- > Cl-, and it may be affected by the type and amounts of anions and active radicals generated. The radical trapping tests and electron spin resonance (ESR) detection display that the O-2(center dot-), h(+), O-1(2), center dot OH and SO4- all contribute to TCH degradation. Meanwhile, possible degradation mechanism, intermediates and degradation pathway of TCH are revealed in CO-C3N4/PMS/vis system. This study will offer a new insight for constructing PMS activation with carbonyl modified g-C3N4 photocatalysis system to achieve effective treatment of organic wastewater. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Narrow temperature window for optimum elastic modulus in ion-beam-modified amorphous carbon	We have investigated the possibility of superhard C3N4 formation by ion-beam implantation into amorphous carbon. The effect of the implantation temperature was examined using 100-keV N+ or 80-keV C+ ions. The apparent elastic modulus data, measured by nanoindentation with load-displacement, shows an optimum value of 91.0+/-0.9 GPa at approximately -100 degrees C. This is much higher than that for unimplanted amorphous carbon, 35.5/-0.3 GPa. Self (carbon) implantation also produces similar modulus enhancements within a narrow temperature window. The maximum elasticity correlates well with an asymmetric diffuse peak around 1,500 cm(-1) in the Raman spectra. A lower dose rate is found to further strengthen the elastic modulus.
Relative stability of some possible phases of graphitic carbon nitride	Various graphitic phases of C3N4 are examined using the local-density approximation plane-wave-pseudopotential approach. These are three forms of p graphite and the P (6) over bar m2 graphite structure. Each differs only in planar stacking and character of planar C-N bonds. Two forms of p graphite are predicted to be stable with energies very close to the P (6) over bar m2 structure. This suggests a strong phase instability of the graphite structures and material softening along the c axis. [S0163-1829(99)09217-6].
Crystalline carbon nitride films formation by chemical vapor deposition	Crystalline carbon nitride films have been synthesized in a rf plasma assisted hot filament chemical vapor deposition system. Large crystalline grains up to similar to 10 mu m in size as well as film-like regions are observed in the morphology of the films. beta-C3N4 with two groups of lattice parameters (one is consistent with the theoretical value and the other is similar to 3% smaller) in the deposited films on polycrystalline Ni substrate has been revealed by x-ray diffraction spectrum (XRD). No Raman shift peaks have been found by Raman scattering measurement, but some presently unknown diffraction peaks appeared in the XRD spectrum. It is proposed that there are possible unknown structures of crystalline C-N in the films. (C) 1996 American Institute of Physics.

Supramolecular Synthesis of Multifunctional Holey Carbon Nitride Nanosheet with High-Efficiency Photocatalytic Performance	Novel carbon nitride (CN) nanosheets are for the first time fabricated by facial supramolecular approach using cyanuric acid, melamine, and 2,4-diamino-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine as starting materials. This is also the first report where the third monomer is used in such synthetic route. With the unique structural advantages for efficient separation of photoinduced charge-hole pairs, light absorption, and the richly available restive sites, the as-synthesized porous CN nanosheets exhibit a superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity whether they are under simulated solar light or under visible light (lambda > 420 nm) irradiation. The hydrogen evolution rate can reach 11 946.1 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) under visible light irradiation, to the best of our knowledge, the highest of all the metal-free CN semiconductor photocatalysts. Also, the synthetic holey CN nanosheets exhibit excellent photocatalytic oxidation performance of high concentration nitric oxide (NO, approximate to 400 ppm) and outstanding photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B under visible light. The supramolecular synthesis of multifunctional CN nanosheets using suitable monomers as raw materials may provide a possible pathway for alleviating energy issues and environmental pollution problems.
Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Performance of g-C3N4/tiO(2) Heterostructure by the Cooperation of Oxygen Vacancy and Protonation Treatment	A g-C3N4/TiO2 (CN/TiO2) nanocomposite was fabricated by depositing proton-functionalized g-C3N4 nanosheets onto the TiO2 nanotube array films with oxygen vacancies. Proton-functionalized g-C3N4 (p-CN) nanosheets was prepared by sonication-exfoliation of bulk g-C3N4 in the presence of hydrochloric acid. Protonation pretreatment of g-C3N4 reduce the size of g-C3N4 and increase the interfacial contact area of g-C3N4 nanosheets with TiO2 nanotube arrays. TiO2 nanotube arrays containing oxygen vacancy (OV-TiO2) was obtained by NaBH4 reduction, which results in the enhanced visible light absorption. As a result, the best photocurrent density of p-CN/OV-TiO2 nanocomposite is 5.3 times higher than that of CN/TiO2 samples. As further confirmed by photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange (MO), p-CN/OV-TiO2 heterostructure exhibit the highest photocatalytic activity among all the prepared samples. This improved photoelectrochemical (PEC) and photocatalytic performance can be attributed to the formation of a direct Z-Scheme heterostructure between protonated g-C3N4 and TiO2 containing oxygen vacancy.

Synthesis of g-C3N4/BiVO4 Nanocomposite Photocatalyst and Its Application in Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2	A visible-light-active graphitic-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4)/BiVO4 nanocomposite photocatalyst was synthesized using a facile ultrasonic dispersion method. The nanocomposite was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and photocurrent response measurements. The photocatalytic activity in the photoreduction of CO2 under visible-light irradiation (lambda>420 nm) was determined. The g-C3N4/BiVO4 catalyst containing 40% (w) g-C3N4 showed the highest photocatalytic activity; it was almost twice that of g-C3N4 nanosheets and four times that of BiVO4. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the formation of heterostructures at the g-C3N4/BiVO4 interface and appropriate alignment of the energy levels between them, which can facilitate separation of photogenerated electrons and holes.
Hybrid of g-C3N4 and MoS2 Integrated onto Cd0.5Zn0.5S: Rational Design with Efficient Charge Transfer for Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity	Rational design of hierarchical nanocomposites is a promising approach for efficient energy harvesting and conversion. A noble-metal-free ternary hierarchical composite, Cd0.5Zn0.5S-g-C3N4-MoS2, has been developed. Materials were chosen based on their relative band-edge alignments and they were studied as a composite for photocatalytic properties. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by measuring the rate of photodriven H-2 evolution with concomitant degradation of organic pollutants, such as Rhodamine B. Optimization of the loading of g-C3N4 and MoS2 onto Cd0.5Zn0.5S results in an enhanced yield of hydrogen evolution by similar to 120% (Cd0.5Zn0.5S-g-C3N4) and similar to 197% (Cd0.5Zn0.5S-g-C3N4-MoS2) compared to bare Cd0.5Zn0.5S. The ternary hybrid, Cd0.5Zn0.5S-g-C3N4-MoS2 resulted in an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 38% at 420 nm. The significant improvement in photocatalytic performance in the composite can be attributed to enhanced interfacial charge transfer of electrons from g-C3N4 to Cd0.5Zn0.5S and MoS2. We surmise that the close proximity of the energies of conduction band edge for each component in the ternary composite promotes better charge separation.
Melem: an efficient metal-free luminescent material	Developing efficient metal-free luminescent materials is a challenging topic because their quantum yields are usually quite low. Here, for the first time, we report a new metal-free blue-emitting melem with a high quantum yield of 56.9%. Rod-like structured melem was synthesized by treating a bulk melem with nitric acid and ethylene glycol. The quantum yield of the rod-like melem (56.9%) is about 1.6 times higher than that of the ordinary melem (35.2%) and is substantially higher than that of bulk g-C3N4 (4.8%), a well-known metal-free blue emission material. This promising blue phosphor, which is easy to synthesize, abundant on earth and contains no metal elements, has great potential for practical applications.
Minimization of Recombination Losses in 3D Nanostructured TiO2 Coated with Few Layered g-C3N4 for Extended Photo-response	We have successfully fabricated 3D (3-dimensional) nanostructures of TiO2 coated with a g-C3N4 layer via hydrothermal and sintering methods to enhance photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance. Due to the coupling of TiO2 and g-C3N4, the nanostructures exhibited good performance as the higher conduction band of g-C3N4, which can be combined with TiO2. To fabricate 3D nanostructures of g-C3N4/TiO2, TiO2 was first grown as a double layer structure on FTO (Fluorine-doped tin oxide) substrate at 150 degrees C for 3 h. After this, the g-C3N4 layer was coated on the TiO2 film at 520 degrees C for 4 h. As-prepared samples were varied according to loading of melamine powder, with values of loading of 0.25 g, 0.5 g, 0.75 g, and 1 g. From SEM and TEM analysis, it was possible to clearly observe the 3D sample morphologies. From the PEC measurement, 0.5 g of g-C3N4/TiO2 film was found to exhibit the highest current density of 0.12 mA/cm(2), along with a long-term stability of 5 h. Compared to the pristine TiO2, and to the 0.25 g, 0.75 g, and 1 g g-C3N4/TiO2 films, the 0.5 g of g-C3N4/TiO2 sample was coated with a thin g-C3N4 layer that caused separation of the electrons and the holes; this led to a decreasing recombination. This unique structure can be used in photoelectrochemical applications.
Visible light-driven ZnO/g-C3N4/carbon xerogel ternary photocatalyst with enhanced activity for 4-chlorophenol degradation	This work aims to synthesize visible light-driven photocatalysts based on zinc oxide, polymeric graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and carbon xerogel. The addition of g-C3N4 and carbon xerogel to the zinc oxide is expected to hinder electron-vacancy recombination, increase specific surface area and reduce bandgap energy. The Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometry confirm the presence of the wurtzite phase of zinc oxide in the materials. Furthermore, the X-ray diffractometry results show that C and N were likely incorporated into the structure of the zinc oxide in the ternary and binary materials, due to the distortion observed in the crystal lattice of the composites. The XPS analysis corroborates the presence of the g-C3N4 in the composite developed, as well as the incorporation of the carbon xerogel into the wurtzite structure. The addition of g-C3N4 and carbon xerogel resulted in significant changes on the morphology of the prepared materials, causing an increase in surface area and textural modification. The optimized ternary composite, which contains 0.25% of g-C3N4 (% w/w), has the highest photocatalytic response among all materials tested, obtaining 92% of 4-chlorophenol degradation under solar radiation and 72% under visible radiation, after 5 h. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the ternary material can be linked to a superior charge mobility and higher visible light response, as shown by chronoamperometry tests and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.
Synthesis and characterization of Graphitic Carbon Nitride/Mesoporous Nano-Silica (g-C3N4/KCC-1) nanocomposite as a novel highly efficient and recyclable photocatalyst for degradation of antibiotic in aqueous solution	Among the pharmaceutical compounds, penicillin G (PG) antibiotic has frequently introduced in waters and wastewater. The present study has investigated a novel Graphitic Carbon Nitride/ Mesoporous Nano-Silica (g-C3N4/KCC-1) nanocomposite for photocatalytic degradation of PG in aqueous solutions. A facile method applied for catalyst synthesis in different condition, and it was structurally and morphologically characterized using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDAX) and Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) which showed successful synthesis of g-C3N4/KCC-1 nanocomposite. The degradation process was examined as a function of pH (3-11), catalyst dose (0.2-0.8 g/L), contact time (10-120 min) and initial PG concentration (10-100 mg/L) under UV radiation. The results demonstrated that maximum degradation of PG was 93.98% in optimized environmental conditions including pH: 7, nanocomposite dosage: 0.6 g/L, contact time: up to 120 min and initial PG concentration: 10 mg/L. Also, datasets were better explained by Langmuir-Hinshelwood model to defining the kinetic of PG degradation in examined conditions.[GRAPHICS].

Influence of Thermal and Photochemical Treatments on Structure and Optical Properties of Single-Layer Carbon Nitride	The temperature of the synthesis of bulk graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) by the polycondensation of melamine, T-p, is found to affect the structure and spectral properties of colloidal single layer carbon nitride (SLCN) nanosheets produced from the bulk GCN via the liquid-phase exfoliation. As T-p is elevated the SLCN sheets get decorated with hydroxyl groups and become smaller due to a higher degree of destruction of the original bulk GCN. Both the size decrease and the presence of OH groups in the SLCN contribute to an increase in the photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield growing up to 56% for T-p = 700 degrees C. The illumination of colloidal SLCN in air-saturated aqueous solutions results in the oxidation of nanosheets with a partial conversion of amino groups into C-OH groups in reactions with oxygen. The oxidation also results in the fragmentation of SLCN particles into smaller moieties and PL quenching. Oppositely, the illumination in argon-saturated solutions results in the reduction of SLCN sheets with the formation of C-C bonds between the components of adducts of SLCN with the products of a partial polyheptazine hydrolysis as well as between separate SLCN particles accompanied by the elimination of amino and hydroxyl groups.
